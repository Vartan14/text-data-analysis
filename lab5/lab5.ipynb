K. C.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK\\n\\nTHE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London, as\\nred and ragged as a cloud of sunset. It was built of a bright\\nbrick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground\\nplan was wild. It had been the outburst of a speculative builder,\\nfaintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes\\nElizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the\\nimpression that the two sovereigns were identical. It was described\\nwith some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any\\ndefinable way produced any art. But although its pretensions to be\\nan intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a\\npleasant place were quite indisputable. The stranger who looked for\\nthe first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very\\noddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them. Nor when\\nhe met the people was he disappointed in this respect. The place\\nwas not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not\\nas a deception but rather as a dream. Even if the people were not\\n\"artists,\" the whole was nevertheless artistic. That young man with\\nthe long, auburn hair and the impudent face--that young man was not\\nreally a poet; but surely he was a poem. That old gentleman with\\nthe wild, white beard and the wild, white hat--that venerable\\nhumbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause\\nof philosophy in others. That scientific gentleman with the bald,\\negg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the\\nairs of science that he assumed. He had not discovered anything new\\nin biology; but what biological creature could he have discovered\\nmore singular than himself? Thus, and thus only, the whole place\\nhad properly to be regarded; it had to be considered not so much\\nas a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished work of art.\\nA man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had\\nstepped into a written comedy.\\n\\nMore especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about\\nnightfall, when the extravagant roofs were dark against the\\nafterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a\\ndrifting cloud. This again was more strongly true of the many\\nnights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often\\nilluminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish\\ntrees like some fierce and monstrous fruit. And this was strongest\\nof all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in the\\nlocality, of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero. It was not\\nby any means the only evening of which he was the hero. On many\\nnights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high,\\ndidactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to\\nwomen. The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the\\nparadoxes of the place. Most of the women were of the kind vaguely\\ncalled emancipated, and professed some protest against male\\nsupremacy. Yet these new women would always pay to a man the\\nextravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him,\\nthat of listening while he is talking. And Mr. Lucian Gregory, the\\nred-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening\\nto, even if one only laughed at the end of it. He put the old cant\\nof the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain\\nimpudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure. He was\\nhelped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance,\\nwhich he worked, as the phrase goes, for all it was worth. His dark\\nred hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman\\'s, and\\ncurved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture.\\nFrom within this almost saintly oval, however, his face projected\\nsuddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of\\ncockney contempt. This combination at once tickled and terrified\\nthe nerves of a neurotic population. He seemed like a walking\\nblasphemy, a blend of the angel and the ape.\\n\\nThis particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else,\\nwill be remembered in that place for its strange sunset. It looked\\nlike the end of the world. All the heaven seemed covered with a\\nquite vivid and palpable plumage; you could only say that the sky\\nwas full of feathers, and of feathers that almost brushed the\\nface. Across the great part of the dome they were grey, with the\\nstrangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale\\ngreen; but towards the west the whole grew past description,\\ntransparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it\\ncovered up the sun like something too good to be seen. The whole\\nwas so close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violent\\nsecrecy. The very empyrean seemed to be a secret. It expressed\\nthat splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism. The\\nvery sky seemed small.\\n\\nI say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening\\nif only by that oppressive sky. There are others who may remember\\nit because it marked the first appearance in the place of the\\nsecond poet of Saffron Park. For a long time the red-haired\\nrevolutionary had reigned without a rival; it was upon the night\\nof the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended. The new poet, who\\nintroduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very\\nmild-looking mortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint, yellow\\nhair. But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked.\\nHe signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet,\\nGregory, upon the whole nature of poetry. He said that he (Syme)\\nwas poet of law, a poet of order; nay, he said he was a poet of\\nrespectability. So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he\\nhad that moment fallen out of that impossible sky.\\n\\nIn fact, Mr. Lucian Gregory, the anarchic poet, connected the two\\nevents.\\n\\n\"It may well be,\" he said, in his sudden lyrical manner, \"it may\\nwell be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is\\nbrought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet.\\nYou say you are a poet of law; I say you are a contradiction in\\nterms. I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the\\nnight you appeared in this garden.\"\\n\\nThe man with the meek blue eyes and the pale, pointed beard endured\\nthese thunders with a certain submissive solemnity. The third party\\nof the group, Gregory\\'s sister Rosamond, who had her brother\\'s\\nbraids of red hair, but a kindlier face underneath them, laughed\\nwith such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave\\ncommonly to the family oracle.\\n\\nGregory resumed in high oratorical good humour.\\n\\n\"An artist is identical with an anarchist,\" he cried. \"You might\\ntranspose the words anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man\\nwho throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment\\nto everything. He sees how much more valuable is one burst of\\nblazing light, one peal of perfect thunder, than the mere common\\nbodies of a few shapeless policemen. An artist disregards all\\ngovernments, abolishes all conventions. The poet delights in\\ndisorder only. If it were not so, the most poetical thing in the\\nworld would be the Underground Railway.\"\\n\\n\"So it is,\" said Mr. Syme.\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else\\nattempted paradox. \"Why do all the clerks and navvies in the\\nrailway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will\\ntell you. It is because they know that the train is going right. It\\nis because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket\\nfor that place they will reach. It is because after they have\\npassed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be\\nVictoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild rapture! oh,\\ntheir eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next\\nstation were unaccountably Baker Street!\"\\n\\n\"It is you who are unpoetical,\" replied the poet Syme. \"If what you\\nsay of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry.\\nThe rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious\\nthing is to miss it. We feel it is epical when man with one wild\\narrow strikes a distant bird. Is it not also epical when man with\\none wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull; because\\nin chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to\\nBagdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that\\nhe does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria. No, take your books\\nof mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of\\npride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give\\nme Bradshaw, who commemorates his victories. Give me Bradshaw, I\\nsay!\"\\n\\n\"Must you go?\" inquired Gregory sarcastically.\\n\\n\"I tell you,\" went on Syme with passion, \"that every time a train\\ncomes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers, and\\nthat man has won a battle against chaos. You say contemptuously\\nthat when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria. I\\nsay that one might do a thousand things instead, and that whenever\\nI really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape. And\\nwhen I hear the guard shout out the word \\'Victoria,\\' it is not an\\nunmeaning word. It is to me the cry of a herald announcing\\nconquest. It is to me indeed \\'Victoria\\'; it is the victory of\\nAdam.\"\\n\\nGregory wagged his heavy, red head with a slow and sad smile.\\n\\n\"And even then,\" he said, \"we poets always ask the question, \\'And\\nwhat is Victoria now that you have got there ?\\' You think Victoria\\nis like the New Jerusalem. We know that the New Jerusalem will only\\nbe like Victoria. Yes, the poet will be discontented even in the\\nstreets of heaven. The poet is always in revolt.\"\\n\\n\"There again,\" said Syme irritably, \"what is there poetical about\\nbeing in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be\\nsea-sick. Being sick is a revolt. Both being sick and being\\nrebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate\\noccasions; but I\\'m hanged if I can see why they are poetical.\\nRevolt in the abstract is--revolting. It\\'s mere vomiting.\"\\n\\nThe girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word, but Syme was\\ntoo hot to heed her.\\n\\n\"It is things going right,\" he cried, \"that is poetical I Our\\ndigestions, for instance, going sacredly and silently right, that\\nis the foundation of all poetry. Yes, the most poetical thing, more\\npoetical than the flowers, more poetical than the stars--the most\\npoetical thing in the world is not being sick.\"\\n\\n\"Really,\" said Gregory superciliously, \"the examples you choose--\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Syme grimly, \"I forgot we had abolished\\nall conventions.\"\\n\\nFor the first time a red patch appeared on Gregory\\'s forehead.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t expect me,\" he said, \"to revolutionise society on this\\nlawn ?\"\\n\\nSyme looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" he said; \"but I suppose that if you were serious\\nabout your anarchism, that is exactly what you would do.\"\\n\\nGregory\\'s big bull\\'s eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry\\nlion, and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think, then,\" he said in a dangerous voice, \"that I am\\nserious about my anarchism?\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon ?\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Am I not serious about my anarchism ?\" cried Gregory, with knotted\\nfists.\\n\\n\"My dear fellow!\" said Syme, and strolled away.\\n\\nWith surprise, but with a curious pleasure, he found Rosamond\\nGregory still in his company.\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme,\" she said, \"do the people who talk like you and my\\nbrother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ?\"\\n\\nSyme smiled.\\n\\n\"Do you ?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"What do you mean ?\" asked the girl, with grave eyes.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Gregory,\" said Syme gently, \"there are many kinds of\\nsincerity and insincerity. When you say \\'thank you\\' for the salt,\\ndo you mean what you say ? No. When you say \\'the world is round,\\'\\ndo you mean what you say ? No. It is true, but you don\\'t mean it.\\nNow, sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does\\nmean. It may be only a half-truth, quarter-truth, tenth-truth; but\\nthen he says more than he means--from sheer force of meaning it.\"\\n\\nShe was looking at him from under level brows; her face was grave\\nand open, and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that\\nunreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most\\nfrivolous woman, the maternal watch which is as old as the world.\\n\\n\"Is he really an anarchist, then?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Only in that sense I speak of,\" replied Syme; \"or if you prefer\\nit, in that nonsense.\"\\n\\nShe drew her broad brows together and said abruptly--\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t really use--bombs or that sort of thing?\"\\n\\nSyme broke into a great laugh, that seemed too large for his slight\\nand somewhat dandified figure.\\n\\n\"Good Lord, no!\" he said, \"that has to be done anonymously.\"\\n\\nAnd at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile, and\\nshe thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregory\\'s absurdity\\nand of his safety.\\n\\nSyme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and\\ncontinued to pour out his opinions. For he was a sincere man, and\\nin spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one.\\nAnd it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man\\nwatches himself too closely. He defended respectability with\\nviolence and exaggeration. He grew passionate in his praise of\\ntidiness and propriety. All the time there was a smell of lilac\\nall round him. Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a\\nbarrel-organ begin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic\\nwords were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world.\\n\\nHe stared and talked at the girl\\'s red hair and amused face for\\nwhat seemed to be a few minutes; and then, feeling that the groups\\nin such a place should mix, rose to his feet. To his astonishment,\\nhe discovered the whole garden empty. Everyone had gone long ago,\\nand he went himself with a rather hurried apology. He left with a\\nsense of champagne in his head, which he could not afterwards\\nexplain. In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no\\npart at all; he never saw her again until all his tale was over.\\nAnd yet, in some indescribable way, she kept recurring like a\\nmotive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards, and the\\nglory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark\\nand ill-drawn tapestries of the night. For what followed was so\\nimprobable, that it might well have been a dream.\\n\\nWhen Syme went out into the starlit street, he found it for the\\nmoment empty. Then he realised (in some odd way) that the silence\\nwas rather a living silence than a dead one. Directly outside the\\ndoor stood a street lamp, whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree\\nthat bent out over the fence behind him. About a foot from the\\nlamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the\\nlamp-post itself. The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the\\nface, in an abrupt shadow, was almost as dark. Only a fringe of\\nfiery hair against the light, and also something aggressive in the\\nattitude, proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory. He had something\\nof the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe.\\n\\nHe made a sort of doubtful salute, which Syme somewhat more\\nformally returned.\\n\\n\"I was waiting for you,\" said Gregory. \"Might I have a moment\\'s\\nconversation?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. About what?\" asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder.\\n\\nGregory struck out with his stick at the lamp-post, and then at the\\ntree. \"About this and this,\" he cried; \"about order and anarchy.\\nThere is your precious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and\\nbarren; and there is anarchy, rich, living, reproducing\\nitself--there is anarchy, splendid in green and gold.\"\\n\\n\"All the same,\" replied Syme patiently, \"just at present you only\\nsee the tree by the light of the lamp. I wonder when you would ever\\nsee the lamp by the light of the tree.\" Then after a pause he said,\\n\"But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only\\nto resume our little argument?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried out Gregory, in a voice that rang down the street, \"I\\ndid not stand here to resume our argument, but to end it for ever.\"\\n\\nThe silence fell again, and Syme, though he understood nothing,\\nlistened instinctively for something serious. Gregory began in a\\nsmooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile.\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme,\" he said, \"this evening you succeeded in doing something\\nrather remarkable. You did something to me that no man born of\\nwoman has ever succeeded in doing before.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Now I remember,\" resumed Gregory reflectively, \"one other person\\nsucceeded in doing it. The captain of a penny steamer (if I\\nremember correctly) at Southend. You have irritated me.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sorry,\" replied Syme with gravity.\\n\\n\"I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped\\nout even with an apology,\" said Gregory very calmly. \"No duel\\ncould wipe it out. If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out.\\nThere is only one way by which that insult can be erased, and that\\nway I choose. I am going, at the possible sacrifice of my life and\\nhonour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said.\"\\n\\n\"In what I said?\"\\n\\n\"You said I was not serious about being an anarchist.\"\\n\\n\"There are degrees of seriousness,\" replied Syme. \"I have never\\ndoubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you\\nthought what you said well worth saying, that you thought a\\nparadox might wake men up to a neglected truth.\"\\n\\nGregory stared at him steadily and painfully.\\n\\n\"And in no other sense,\" he asked, \"you think me serious? You think\\nme a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths. You do not think that\\nin a deeper, a more deadly sense, I am serious.\"\\n\\nSyme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road.\\n\\n\"Serious!\" he cried. \"Good Lord! is this street serious? Are these\\ndamned Chinese lanterns serious? Is the whole caboodle serious?\\nOne comes here and talks a pack of bosh, and perhaps some sense as\\nwell, but I should think very little of a man who didn\\'t keep\\nsomething in the background of his life that was more serious than\\nall this talking--something more serious, whether it was religion\\nor only drink.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Gregory, his face darkening, \"you shall see\\nsomething more serious than either drink or religion.\"\\n\\nSyme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregory\\nagain opened his lips.\\n\\n\"You spoke just now of having a religion. Is it really true that\\nyou have one?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Syme with a beaming smile, \"we are all Catholics now.\"\\n\\n\"Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your\\nreligion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to\\ntell you to any son of Adam, and especially not to the police?\\nWill you swear that! If you will take upon yourself this awful\\nabnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow\\nthat you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream\\nabout, I will promise you in return--\"\\n\\n\"You will promise me in return?\" inquired Syme, as the other\\npaused.\\n\\n\"I will promise you a very entertaining evening.\" Syme suddenly\\ntook off his hat.\\n\\n\"Your offer,\" he said, \"is far too idiotic to be declined. You say\\nthat a poet is always an anarchist. I disagree; but I hope at least\\nthat he is always a sportsman. Permit me, here and now, to swear as\\na Christian, and promise as a good comrade and a fellow-artist,\\nthat I will not report anything of this, whatever it is, to the\\npolice. And now, in the name of Colney Hatch, what is it?\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Gregory, with placid irrelevancy, \"that we will\\ncall a cab.\"\\n\\nHe gave two long whistles, and a hansom came rattling down the\\nroad. The two got into it in silence. Gregory gave through the\\ntrap the address of an obscure public-house on the Chiswick bank\\nof the river. The cab whisked itself away again, and in it these\\ntwo fantastics quitted their fantastic town.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nTHE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME\\n\\nTHE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop,\\ninto which Gregory rapidly conducted his companion. They seated\\nthemselves in a close and dim sort of bar-parlour, at a stained\\nwooden table with one wooden leg. The room was so small and dark,\\nthat very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned,\\nbeyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded.\\n\\n\"Will you take a little supper?\" asked Gregory politely. \"The pate\\nde foie gras is not good here, but I can recommend the game.\"\\n\\nSyme received the remark with stolidity, imagining it to be a joke.\\nAccepting the vein of humour, he said, with a well-bred\\nindifference--\\n\\n\"Oh, bring me some lobster mayonnaise.\"\\n\\nTo his indescribable astonishment, the man only said \"Certainly,\\nsir!\" and went away apparently to get it.\\n\\n\"What will you drink?\" resumed Gregory, with the same careless yet\\napologetic air. \"I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself; I have\\ndined. But the champagne can really be trusted. Do let me start you\\nwith a half-bottle of Pommery at least?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" said the motionless Syme. \"You are very good.\"\\n\\nHis further attempts at conversation, somewhat disorganised in\\nthemselves, were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the\\nactual appearance of the lobster. Syme tasted it, and found it\\nparticularly good. Then he suddenly began to eat with great\\nrapidity and appetite.\\n\\n\"Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!\" he said to Gregory,\\nsmiling. \"I don\\'t often have the luck to have a dream like this. It\\nis new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster. It is commonly\\nthe other way.\"\\n\\n\"You are not asleep, I assure you,\" said Gregory. \"You are, on the\\ncontrary, close to the most actual and rousing moment of your\\nexistence. Ah, here comes your champagne! I admit that there may be\\na slight disproportion, let us say, between the inner arrangements\\nof this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior.\\nBut that is all our modesty. We are the most modest men that ever\\nlived on earth.\"\\n\\n\"And who are we?\" asked Syme, emptying his champagne glass.\\n\\n\"It is quite simple,\" replied Gregory. \"We are the serious\\nanarchists, in whom you do not believe.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Syme shortly. \"You do yourselves well in drinks.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we are serious about everything,\" answered Gregory.\\n\\nThen after a pause he added--\\n\\n\"If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little,\\ndon\\'t put it down to your inroads into the champagne. I don\\'t wish\\nyou to do yourself an injustice.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if I am not drunk, I am mad,\" replied Syme with perfect\\ncalm; \"but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either\\ncondition. May I smoke?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly!\" said Gregory, producing a cigar-case. \"Try one of\\nmine.\"\\n\\nSyme took the cigar, clipped the end off with a cigar-cutter out\\nof his waistcoat pocket, put it in his mouth, lit it slowly, and\\nlet out a long cloud of smoke. It is not a little to his credit\\nthat he performed these rites with so much composure, for almost\\nbefore he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to\\nrevolve, first slowly, and then rapidly, as if at an insane\\nseance.\\n\\n\"You must not mind it,\" said Gregory; \"it\\'s a kind of screw.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" said Syme placidly, \"a kind of screw. How simple that\\nis!\"\\n\\nThe next moment the smoke of his cigar, which had been wavering\\nacross the room in snaky twists, went straight up as if from a\\nfactory chimney, and the two, with their chairs and table, shot\\ndown through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them. They\\nwent rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift\\ncut loose, and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom. But\\nwhen Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red\\nsubterranean light, Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown\\nover the other, and had not turned a yellow hair.\\n\\nGregory led him down a low, vaulted passage, at the end of which\\nwas the red light. It was an enormous crimson lantern, nearly as\\nbig as a fireplace, fixed over a small but heavy iron door. In the\\ndoor there was a sort of hatchway or grating, and on this Gregory\\nstruck five times. A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him\\nwho he was. To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply,\\n\"Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.\" The heavy hinges began to move; it was\\nobviously some kind of password.\\n\\nInside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a\\nnetwork of steel. On a second glance, Syme saw that the glittering\\npattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and\\nrevolvers, closely packed or interlocked.\\n\\n\"I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities,\" said Gregory;\\n\"we have to be very strict here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t apologise,\" said Syme. \"I know your passion for law and\\norder,\" and he stepped into the passage lined with the steel\\nweapons. With his long, fair hair and rather foppish frock-coat, he\\nlooked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked down\\nthat shining avenue of death.\\n\\nThey passed through several such passages, and came out at last\\ninto a queer steel chamber with curved walls, almost spherical in\\nshape, but presenting, with its tiers of benches, something of the\\nappearance of a scientific lecture-theatre. There were no rifles or\\npistols in this apartment, but round the walls of it were hung more\\ndubious and dreadful shapes, things that looked like the bulbs of\\niron plants, or the eggs of iron birds. They were bombs, and the\\nvery room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb. Syme knocked his\\ncigar ash off against the wall, and went in.\\n\\n\"And now, my dear Mr. Syme,\" said Gregory, throwing himself in an\\nexpansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb, \"now we are\\nquite cosy, so let us talk properly. Now no human words can give\\nyou any notion of why I brought you here. It was one of those quite\\narbitrary emotions, like jumping off a cliff or falling in love.\\nSuffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow,\\nand, to do you justice, you are still. I would break twenty oaths\\nof secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg. That way you\\nhave of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of\\nconfession. Well, you said that you were quite certain I was not a\\nserious anarchist. Does this place strike you as being serious?\"\\n\\n\"It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety,\" assented\\nSyme; \"but may I ask you two questions? You need not fear to give\\nme information, because, as you remember, you very wisely extorted\\nfrom me a promise not to tell the police, a promise I shall\\ncertainly keep. So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries.\\nFirst of all, what is it really all about? What is it you object\\nto? You want to abolish Government?\"\\n\\n\"To abolish God!\" said Gregory, opening the eyes of a fanatic. \"We\\ndo not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations;\\nthat sort of anarchism does exist, but it is a mere branch of the\\nNonconformists. We dig deeper and we blow you higher. We wish to\\ndeny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue, honour\\nand treachery, upon which mere rebels base themselves. The silly\\nsentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of\\nMan! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and\\nWrong.\"\\n\\n\"And Right and Left,\" said Syme with a simple eagerness, \"I hope\\nyou will abolish them too. They are much more troublesome to me.\"\\n\\n\"You spoke of a second question,\" snapped Gregory.\\n\\n\"With pleasure,\" resumed Syme. \"In all your present acts and\\nsurroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy. I have an\\naunt who lived over a shop, but this is the first time I have\\nfound people living from preference under a public-house. You have\\na heavy iron door. You cannot pass it without submitting to the\\nhumiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain. You surround\\nyourself with steel instruments which make the place, if I may say\\nso, more impressive than homelike. May I ask why, after taking all\\nthis trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth,\\nyou then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to\\nevery silly woman in Saffron Park?\"\\n\\nGregory smiled.\\n\\n\"The answer is simple,\" he said. \"I told you I was a serious\\nanarchist, and you did not believe me. Nor do they believe me.\\nUnless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe\\nme.\"\\n\\nSyme smoked thoughtfully, and looked at him with interest. Gregory\\nwent on.\\n\\n\"The history of the thing might amuse you,\" he said. \"When first I\\nbecame one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable\\ndisguises. I dressed up as a bishop. I read up all about bishops\\nin our anarchist pamphlets, in Superstition the Vampire and\\nPriests of Prey. I certainly understood from them that bishops are\\nstrange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind.\\nI was misinformed. When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters\\nin a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, \\'Down! down!\\npresumptuous human reason!\\' they found out in some way that I was\\nnot a bishop at all. I was nabbed at once. Then I made up as a\\nmillionaire; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that\\na fool could see that I was quite poor. Then I tried being a\\nmajor. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough\\nintellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like\\nNietzsche, admire violence--the proud, mad war of Nature and all\\nthat, you know. I threw myself into the major. I drew my sword and\\nwaved it constantly. I called out \\'Blood!\\' abstractedly, like a\\nman calling for wine. I often said, \\'Let the weak perish; it is\\nthe Law.\\' Well, well, it seems majors don\\'t do this. I was nabbed\\nagain. At last I went in despair to the President of the Central\\nAnarchist Council, who is the greatest man in Europe.\"\\n\\n\"What is his name?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"You would not know it,\" answered Gregory. \"That is his greatness.\\nCaesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of, and\\nthey were heard of. He puts all his genius into not being heard of,\\nand he is not heard of. But you cannot be for five minutes in the\\nroom with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have\\nbeen children in his hands.\"\\n\\nHe was silent and even pale for a moment, and then resumed--\\n\\n\"But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling\\nas an epigram, and yet as practical as the Bank of England. I said\\nto him, \\'What disguise will hide me from the world? What can I find\\nmore respectable than bishops and majors?\\' He looked at me with his\\nlarge but indecipherable face. \\'You want a safe disguise, do you?\\nYou want a dress which will guarantee you harmless; a dress in\\nwhich no one would ever look for a bomb?\\' I nodded. He suddenly\\nlifted his lion\\'s voice. \\'Why, then, dress up as an anarchist, you\\nfool!\\' he roared so that the room shook. \\'Nobody will ever expect\\nyou to do anything dangerous then.\\' And he turned his broad back\\non me without another word. I took his advice, and have never\\nregretted it. I preached blood and murder to those women day and\\nnight, and--by God!--they would let me wheel their perambulators.\"\\n\\nSyme sat watching him with some respect in his large, blue eyes.\\n\\n\"You took me in,\" he said. \"It is really a smart dodge.\"\\n\\nThen after a pause he added--\\n\\n\"What do you call this tremendous President of yours?\"\\n\\n\"We generally call him Sunday,\" replied Gregory with simplicity.\\n\\'You see, there are seven members of the Central Anarchist\\nCouncil, and they are named after days of the week. He is called\\nSunday, by some of his admirers Bloody Sunday. It is curious you\\nshould mention the matter, because the very night you have dropped\\nin (if I may so express it) is the night on which our London\\nbranch, which assembles in this room, has to elect its own deputy\\nto fill a vacancy in the Council. The gentleman who has for some\\ntime past played, with propriety and general applause, the\\ndifficult part of Thursday, has died quite suddenly. Consequently,\\nwe have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor.\"\\n\\nHe got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of\\nsmiling embarrassment.\\n\\n\"I feel somehow as if you were my mother, Syme,\" he continued\\ncasually. \"I feel that I can confide anything to you, as you have\\npromised to tell nobody. In fact, I will confide to you something\\nthat I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be\\ncoming to the room in about ten minutes. We shall, of course, go\\nthrough a form of election; but I don\\'t mind telling you that it is\\npractically certain what the result will be.\" He looked down for a\\nmoment modestly. \"It is almost a settled thing that I am to be\\nThursday.\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow.\" said Syme heartily, \"I congratulate you. A great\\ncareer!\"\\n\\nGregory smiled in deprecation, and walked across the room, talking\\nrapidly.\\n\\n\"As a matter of fact, everything is ready for me on this table,\" he\\nsaid, \"and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible.\"\\n\\nSyme also strolled across to the table, and found lying across it a\\nwalking-stick, which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick,\\na large Colt\\'s revolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask of\\nbrandy. Over the chair, beside the table, was thrown a\\nheavy-looking cape or cloak.\\n\\n\"I have only to get the form of election finished,\" continued\\nGregory with animation, \"then I snatch up this cloak and stick,\\nstuff these other things into my pocket, step out of a door in\\nthis cavern, which opens on the river, where there is a steam-tug\\nalready waiting for me, and then--then--oh, the wild joy of being\\nThursday!\" And he clasped his hands.\\n\\nSyme, who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor,\\ngot to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation.\\n\\n\"Why is it,\" he asked vaguely, \"that I think you are quite a decent\\nfellow? Why do I positively like you, Gregory?\" He paused a moment,\\nand then added with a sort of fresh curiosity, \"Is it because you\\nare such an ass?\"\\n\\nThere was a thoughtful silence again, and then he cried out--\\n\\n\"Well, damn it all! this is the funniest situation I have ever been\\nin in my life, and I am going to act accordingly. Gregory, I gave\\nyou a promise before I came into this place. That promise I would\\nkeep under red-hot pincers. Would you give me, for my own safety, a\\nlittle promise of the same kind? \"\\n\\n\"A promise?\" asked Gregory, wondering.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme very seriously, \"a promise. I swore before God\\nthat I would not tell your secret to the police. Will you swear by\\nHumanity, or whatever beastly thing you believe in, that you will\\nnot tell my secret to the anarchists?\"\\n\\n\"Your secret?\" asked the staring Gregory. \"Have you got a secret?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme, \"I have a secret.\" Then after a pause, \"Will you\\nswear?\"\\n\\nGregory glared at him gravely for a few moments, and then said\\nabruptly--\\n\\n\"You must have bewitched me, but I feel a furious curiosity about\\nyou. Yes, I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell\\nme. But look sharp, for they will be here in a couple of minutes.\"\\n\\nSyme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long, white hands into\\nhis long, grey trousers\\' pockets. Almost as he did so there came\\nfive knocks on the outer grating, proclaiming the arrival of the\\nfirst of the conspirators.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme slowly, \"I don\\'t know how to tell you the truth\\nmore shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as\\nan aimless poet is not confined to you or your President. We have\\nknown the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard.\"\\n\\nGregory tried to spring up straight, but he swayed thrice.\\n\\n\"What do you say?\" he asked in an inhuman voice.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme simply, \"I am a police detective. But I think I\\nhear your friends coming.\"\\n\\nFrom the doorway there came a murmur of \"Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.\"\\nIt was repeated twice and thrice, and then thirty times, and the\\ncrowd of Joseph Chamberlains (a solemn thought) could be heard\\ntrampling down the corridor.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nTHE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY\\n\\nBEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway,\\nGregory\\'s stunned surprise had fallen from him. He was beside the\\ntable with a bound, and a noise in his throat like a wild beast.\\nHe caught up the Colt\\'s revolver and took aim at Syme. Syme did\\nnot flinch, but he put up a pale and polite hand.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be such a silly man,\" he said, with the effeminate dignity\\nof a curate. \"Don\\'t you see it\\'s not necessary? Don\\'t you see that\\nwe\\'re both in the same boat? Yes, and jolly sea-sick.\"\\n\\nGregory could not speak, but he could not fire either, and he\\nlooked his question.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you see we\\'ve checkmated each other?\" cried Syme. \"I can\\'t\\ntell the police you are an anarchist. You can\\'t tell the anarchists\\nI\\'m a policeman. I can only watch you, knowing what you are; you\\ncan only watch me, knowing what I am. In short, it\\'s a lonely,\\nintellectual duel, my head against yours. I\\'m a policeman deprived\\nof the help of the police. You, my poor fellow, are an anarchist\\ndeprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so\\nessential to anarchy. The one solitary difference is in your\\nfavour. You are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen; I am\\nsurrounded by inquisitive anarchists. I cannot betray you, but I\\nmight betray myself. Come, come! wait and see me betray myself. I\\nshall do it so nicely.\"\\n\\nGregory put the pistol slowly down, still staring at Syme as if he\\nwere a sea-monster.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe in immortality,\" he said at last, \"but if, after\\nall this, you were to break your word, God would make a hell only\\nfor you, to howl in for ever.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not break my word,\" said Syme sternly, \"nor will you\\nbreak yours. Here are your friends.\"\\n\\nThe mass of the anarchists entered the room heavily, with a\\nslouching and somewhat weary gait; but one little man, with a\\nblack beard and glasses--a man somewhat of the type of Mr. Tim\\nHealy--detached himself, and bustled forward with some papers\\nin his hand.\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory,\" he said, \"I suppose this man is a delegate?\"\\n\\nGregory, taken by surprise, looked down and muttered the name of\\nSyme; but Syme replied almost pertly--\\n\\n\"I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it\\nhard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate.\"\\n\\nThe brow of the little man with the black beard was, however, still\\ncontracted with something like suspicion.\\n\\n\"What branch do you represent?\" he asked sharply.\\n\\n\"I should hardly call it a branch,\" said Syme, laughing; \"I should\\ncall it at the very least a root.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"The fact is,\" said Syme serenely, \"the truth is I am a\\nSabbatarian. I have been specially sent here to see that you show\\na due observance of Sunday.\"\\n\\nThe little man dropped one of his papers, and a flicker of fear\\nwent over all the faces of the group. Evidently the awful\\nPresident, whose name was Sunday, did sometimes send down such\\nirregular ambassadors to such branch meetings.\\n\\n\"Well, comrade,\" said the man with the papers after a pause, \"I\\nsuppose we\\'d better give you a seat in the meeting?\"\\n\\n\"If you ask my advice as a friend,\" said Syme with severe\\nbenevolence, \"I think you\\'d better.\"\\n\\nWhen Gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end, with a sudden safety\\nfor his rival, he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful\\nthought. He was, indeed, in an agony of diplomacy. It was clear\\nthat Syme\\'s inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all\\nmerely accidental dilemmas. Little was to be hoped from them. He\\ncould not himself betray Syme, partly from honour, but partly also\\nbecause, if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy\\nhim, the Syme who escaped would be a Syme freed from all obligation\\nof secrecy, a Syme who would simply walk to the nearest police\\nstation. After all, it was only one night\\'s discussion, and only\\none detective who would know of it. He would let out as little as\\npossible of their plans that night, and then let Syme go, and\\nchance it.\\n\\nHe strode across to the group of anarchists, which was already\\ndistributing itself along the benches.\\n\\n\"I think it is time we began,\" he said; \"the steam-tug is waiting\\non the river already. I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair.\"\\n\\nThis being approved by a show of hands, the little man with the\\npapers slipped into the presidential seat.\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" he began, as sharp as a pistol-shot, \"our meeting\\ntonight is important, though it need not be long. This branch\\nhas always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central\\nEuropean Council. We have elected many and splendid Thursdays. We\\nall lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the\\npost until last week. As you know, his services to the cause were\\nconsiderable. He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton\\nwhich, under happier circumstances, ought to have killed everybody\\non the pier. As you also know, his death was as self-denying as\\nhis life, for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of\\nchalk and water as a substitute for milk, which beverage he\\nregarded as barbaric, and as involving cruelty to the cow.\\nCruelty, or anything approaching to cruelty, revolted him always.\\nBut it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met, but for a\\nharder task. It is difficult properly to praise his qualities, but\\nit is more difficult to replace them. Upon you, comrades, it\\ndevolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man\\nwho shall be Thursday. If any comrade suggests a name I will put\\nit to the vote. If no comrade suggests a name, I can only tell\\nmyself that that dear dynamiter, who is gone from us, has carried\\ninto the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his\\ninnocence.\"\\n\\nThere was a stir of almost inaudible applause, such as is sometimes\\nheard in church. Then a large old man, with a long and venerable\\nwhite beard, perhaps the only real working-man present, rose\\nlumberingly and said--\\n\\n\"I move that Comrade Gregory be elected Thursday,\" and sat\\nlumberingly down again.\\n\\n\"Does anyone second?\" asked the chairman.\\n\\nA little man with a velvet coat and pointed beard seconded.\\n\\n\"Before I put the matter to the vote,\" said the chairman, \"I will\\ncall on Comrade Gregory to make a statement.\"\\n\\nGregory rose amid a great rumble of applause. His face was deadly\\npale, so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet.\\nBut he was smiling and altogether at ease. He had made up his mind,\\nand he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white\\nroad. His best chance was to make a softened and ambiguous speech,\\nsuch as would leave on the detective\\'s mind the impression that the\\nanarchist brotherhood was a very mild affair after all. He believed\\nin his own literary power, his capacity for suggesting fine shades\\nand picking perfect words. He thought that with care he could\\nsucceed, in spite of all the people around him, in conveying an\\nimpression of the institution, subtly and delicately false. Syme\\nhad once thought that anarchists, under all their bravado, were\\nonly playing the fool. Could he not now, in the hour of peril, make\\nSyme think so again?\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" began Gregory, in a low but penetrating voice, \"it is\\nnot necessary for me to tell you what is my policy, for it is your\\npolicy also. Our belief has been slandered, it has been disfigured,\\nit has been utterly confused and concealed, but it has never been\\naltered. Those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go\\neverywhere and anywhere to get their information, except to us,\\nexcept to the fountain head. They learn about anarchists from\\nsixpenny novels; they learn about anarchists from tradesmen\\'s\\nnewspapers; they learn about anarchists from Ally Sloper\\'s\\nHalf-Holiday and the Sporting Times. They never learn about\\nanarchists from anarchists. We have no chance of denying the\\nmountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end\\nof Europe to another. The man who has always heard that we are\\nwalking plagues has never heard our reply. I know that he will not\\nhear it tonight, though my passion were to rend the roof. For it is\\ndeep, deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to\\nassemble, as the Christians assembled in the Catacombs. But if, by\\nsome incredible accident, there were here tonight a man who all his\\nlife had thus immensely misunderstood us, I would put this question\\nto him: \\'When those Christians met in those Catacombs, what sort of\\nmoral reputation had they in the streets above? What tales were\\ntold of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another? Suppose\\'\\n(I would say to him), \\'suppose that we are only repeating that\\nstill mysterious paradox of history. Suppose we seem as shocking as\\nthe Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians.\\nSuppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as\\nmeek.\"\\'\\n\\nThe applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been\\ngradually growing fainter, and at the last word it stopped\\nsuddenly. In the abrupt silence, the man with the velvet jacket\\nsaid, in a high, squeaky voice--\\n\\n\"I\\'m not meek!\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Witherspoon tells us,\" resumed Gregory, \"that he is not\\nmeek. Ah, how little he knows himself! His words are, indeed,\\nextravagant; his appearance is ferocious, and even (to an ordinary\\ntaste) unattractive. But only the eye of a friendship as deep and\\ndelicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness\\nwhich lies at the base of him, too deep even for himself to see. I\\nrepeat, we are the true early Christians, only that we come too\\nlate. We are simple, as they revere simple--look at Comrade\\nWitherspoon. We are modest, as they were modest--look at me. We are\\nmerciful--\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" called out Mr. Witherspoon with the velvet jacket.\\n\\n\"I say we are merciful,\" repeated Gregory furiously, \"as the early\\nChristians were merciful. Yet this did not prevent their being\\naccused of eating human flesh. We do not eat human flesh--\"\\n\\n\"Shame!\" cried Witherspoon. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Witherspoon,\" said Gregory, with a feverish gaiety, \"is\\nanxious to know why nobody eats him (laughter). In our society, at\\nany rate, which loves him sincerely, which is founded upon love--\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" said Witherspoon, \"down with love.\"\\n\\n\"Which is founded upon love,\" repeated Gregory, grinding his teeth,\\n\"there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue\\nas a body, or which I should pursue were I chosen as the\\nrepresentative of that body. Superbly careless of the slanders that\\nrepresent us as assassins and enemies of human society, we shall\\npursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure, the\\npermanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity.\"\\n\\nGregory resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead.\\nThe silence was sudden and awkward, but the chairman rose like an\\nautomaton, and said in a colourless voice--\\n\\n\"Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory?\"\\n\\nThe assembly seemed vague and sub-consciously disappointed, and\\nComrade Witherspoon moved restlessly on his seat and muttered in\\nhis thick beard. By the sheer rush of routine, however, the motion\\nwould have been put and carried. But as the chairman was opening\\nhis mouth to put it, Syme sprang to his feet and said in a small\\nand quiet voice--\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Chairman, I oppose.\"\\n\\nThe most effective fact in oratory is an unexpected change in the\\nvoice. Mr. Gabriel Syme evidently understood oratory. Having said\\nthese first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief\\nsimplicity, he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as\\nif one of the guns had gone off.\\n\\n\"Comrades!\" he cried, in a voice that made every man jump out of\\nhis boots, \"have we come here for this? Do we live underground like\\nrats in order to listen to talk like this? This is talk we might\\nlisten to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat. Do we line\\nthese walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone\\nshould come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us, \\'Be good, and\\nyou will be happy,\\' \\'Honesty is the best policy,\\' and \\'Virtue is\\nits own reward\\'? There was not a word in Comrade Gregory\\'s address\\nto which a curate could not have listened with pleasure (hear,\\nhear). But I am not a curate (loud cheers), and I did not listen to\\nit with pleasure (renewed cheers). The man who is fitted to make a\\ngood curate is not fitted to make a resolute, forcible, and\\nefficient Thursday (hear, hear).\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory has told us, in only too apologetic a tone, that\\nwe are not the enemies of society. But I say that we are the\\nenemies of society, and so much the worse for society. We are the\\nenemies of society, for society is the enemy of humanity, its\\noldest and its most pitiless enemy (hear, hear). Comrade Gregory\\nhas told us (apologetically again) that we are not murderers. There\\nI agree. We are not murderers, we are executioners (cheers).\"\\n\\nEver since Syme had risen Gregory had sat staring at him, his face\\nidiotic with astonishment. Now in the pause his lips of clay\\nparted, and he said, with an automatic and lifeless distinctness--\\n\\n\"You damnable hypocrite!\"\\n\\nSyme looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale\\nblue ones, and said with dignity--\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy. He knows as well as I do\\nthat I am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty.\\nI do not mince words. I do not pretend to. I say that Comrade\\nGregory is unfit to be Thursday for all his amiable qualities. He\\nis unfit to be Thursday because of his amiable qualities. We do not\\nwant the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy\\n(hear, hear). This is no time for ceremonial politeness, neither is\\nit a time for ceremonial modesty. I set myself against Comrade\\nGregory as I would set myself against all the Governments of\\nEurope, because the anarchist who has given himself to anarchy has\\nforgotten modesty as much as he has forgotten pride (cheers). I am\\nnot a man at all. I am a cause (renewed cheers). I set myself\\nagainst Comrade Gregory as impersonally and as calmly as I should\\nchoose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the\\nwall; and I say that rather than have Gregory and his\\nmilk-and-water methods on the Supreme Council, I would offer myself\\nfor election--\"\\n\\nHis sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause. The\\nfaces, that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his\\ntirade grew more and more uncompromising, were now distorted with\\ngrins of anticipation or cloven with delighted cries. At the\\nmoment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of\\nThursday, a roar of excitement and assent broke forth, and became\\nuncontrollable, and at the same moment Gregory sprang to his feet,\\nwith foam upon his mouth, and shouted against the shouting.\\n\\n\"Stop, you blasted madmen!\" he cried, at the top of a voice that\\ntore his throat. \"Stop, you--\"\\n\\nBut louder than Gregory\\'s shouting and louder than the roar of the\\nroom came the voice of Syme, still speaking in a peal of pitiless\\nthunder--\\n\\n\"I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us\\nmurderers; I go to earn it (loud and prolonged cheering). To the\\npriest who says these men are the enemies of religion, to the\\njudge who says these men are the enemies of law, to the fat\\nparliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order and\\npublic decency, to all these I will reply, \\'You are false kings,\\nbut you are true prophets. I am come to destroy you, and to fulfil\\nyour prophecies.\\'\"\\n\\nThe heavy clamour gradually died away, but before it had ceased\\nWitherspoon had jumped to his feet, his hair and beard all on end,\\nand had said--\\n\\n\"I move, as an amendment, that Comrade Syme be appointed to the post.\"\\n\\n\"Stop all this, I tell you!\" cried Gregory, with frantic face and\\nhands. \"Stop it, it is all--\"\\n\\nThe voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent.\\n\\n\"Does anyone second this amendment?\" he said. A tall, tired man,\\nwith melancholy eyes and an American chin beard, was observed on\\nthe back bench to be slowly rising to his feet. Gregory had been\\nscreaming for some time past; now there was a change in his accent,\\nmore shocking than any scream. \"I end all this!\" he said, in a\\nvoice as heavy as stone.\\n\\n\"This man cannot be elected. He is a--\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme, quite motionless, \"what is he?\" Gregory\\'s mouth\\nworked twice without sound; then slowly the blood began to crawl\\nback into his dead face. \"He is a man quite inexperienced in our\\nwork,\" he said, and sat down abruptly.\\n\\nBefore he had done so, the long, lean man with the American beard\\nwas again upon his feet, and was repeating in a high American\\nmonotone--\\n\\n\"I beg to second the election of Comrade Syme.\"\\n\\n\"The amendment will, as usual, be put first,\" said Mr. Buttons, the\\nchairman, with mechanical rapidity.\\n\\n\"The question is that Comrade Syme--\"\\n\\nGregory had again sprung to his feet, panting and passionate.\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" he cried out, \"I am not a madman.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Mr. Witherspoon.\\n\\n\"I am not a madman,\" reiterated Gregory, with a frightful sincerity\\nwhich for a moment staggered the room, \"but I give you a counsel\\nwhich you can call mad if you like. No, I will not call it a\\ncounsel, for I can give you no reason for it. I will call it a\\ncommand. Call it a mad command, but act upon it. Strike, but hear\\nme! Kill me, but obey me! Do not elect this man.\" Truth is so\\nterrible, even in fetters, that for a moment Syme\\'s slender and\\ninsane victory swayed like a reed. But you could not have guessed\\nit from Syme\\'s bleak blue eyes. He merely began--\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory commands--\"\\n\\nThen the spell was snapped, and one anarchist called out to Gregory--\\n\\n\"Who are you? You are not Sunday\"; and another anarchist added in a\\nheavier voice, \"And you are not Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" cried Gregory, in a voice like that of a martyr who in\\nan ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain, \"it is nothing to me\\nwhether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave. If you\\nwill not take my command, accept my degradation. I kneel to you. I\\nthrow myself at your feet. I implore you. Do not elect this man.\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory,\" said the chairman after a painful pause, \"this\\nis really not quite dignified.\"\\n\\nFor the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a\\nreal silence. Then Gregory fell back in his seat, a pale wreck of a\\nman, and the chairman repeated, like a piece of clock-work suddenly\\nstarted again--\\n\\n\"The question is that Comrade Syme be elected to the post of\\nThursday on the General Council.\"\\n\\nThe roar rose like the sea, the hands rose like a forest, and three\\nminutes afterwards Mr. Gabriel Syme, of the Secret Police Service,\\nwas elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council of the\\nAnarchists of Europe.\\n\\nEveryone in the room seemed to feel the tug waiting on the river,\\nthe sword-stick and the revolver, waiting on the table. The instant\\nthe election was ended and irrevocable, and Syme had received the\\npaper proving his election, they all sprang to their feet, and the\\nfiery groups moved and mixed in the room. Syme found himself,\\nsomehow or other, face to face with Gregory, who still regarded him\\nwith a stare of stunned hatred. They were silent for many minutes.\\n\\n\"You are a devil!\" said Gregory at last.\\n\\n\"And you are a gentleman,\" said Syme with gravity.\\n\\n\"It was you that entrapped me,\" began Gregory, shaking from head\\nto foot, \"entrapped me into--\"\\n\\n\"Talk sense,\" said Syme shortly. \"Into what sort of devils\\'\\nparliament have you entrapped me, if it comes to that? You made me\\nswear before I made you. Perhaps we are both doing what we think\\nright. But what we think right is so damned different that there\\ncan be nothing between us in the way of concession. There is\\nnothing possible between us but honour and death,\" and he pulled\\nthe great cloak about his shoulders and picked up the flask from\\nthe table.\\n\\n\"The boat is quite ready,\" said Mr. Buttons, bustling up. \"Be good\\nenough to step this way.\"\\n\\nWith a gesture that revealed the shop-walker, he led Syme down a\\nshort, iron-bound passage, the still agonised Gregory following\\nfeverishly at their heels. At the end of the passage was a door,\\nwhich Buttons opened sharply, showing a sudden blue and silver\\npicture of the moonlit river, that looked like a scene in a\\ntheatre. Close to the opening lay a dark, dwarfish steam-launch,\\nlike a baby dragon with one red eye.\\n\\nAlmost in the act of stepping on board, Gabriel Syme turned to the\\ngaping Gregory.\\n\\n\"You have kept your word,\" he said gently, with his face in shadow.\\n\"You are a man of honour, and I thank you. You have kept it even\\ndown to a small particular. There was one special thing you\\npromised me at the beginning of the affair, and which you have\\ncertainly given me by the end of it.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" cried the chaotic Gregory. \"What did I promise\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"A very entertaining evening,\" said Syme, and he made a military\\nsalute with the sword-stick as the steamboat slid away.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTHE TALE OF A DETECTIVE\\n\\nGABRIEL SYME was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet;\\nhe was really a poet who had become a detective. Nor was his hatred\\nof anarchy hypocritical. He was one of those who are driven early\\nin life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly\\nof most revolutionists. He had not attained it by any tame\\ntradition. His respectability was spontaneous and sudden, a\\nrebellion against rebellion. He came of a family of cranks, in\\nwhich all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his\\nuncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an\\nunsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His\\nfather cultivated art and self-realisation; his mother went in for\\nsimplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years,\\nwas wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of\\nabsinth and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike. The\\nmore his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more\\ndid his father expand into a more than pagan latitude; and by the\\ntime the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism, the latter had\\npretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism.\\n\\nBeing surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from\\ninfancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into\\nthe only thing left--sanity. But there was just enough in him of\\nthe blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common\\nsense a little too fierce to be sensible. His hatred of modern\\nlawlessness had been crowned also by an accident. It happened that\\nhe was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite\\noutrage. He had been blind and deaf for a moment, and then seen,\\nthe smoke clearing, the broken windows and the bleeding faces.\\nAfter that he went about as usual--quiet, courteous, rather gentle;\\nbut there was a spot on his mind that was not sane. He did not\\nregard anarchists, as most of us do, as a handful of morbid men,\\ncombining ignorance with intellectualism. He regarded them as a\\nhuge and pitiless peril, like a Chinese invasion.\\n\\nHe poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste-paper baskets\\na torrent of tales, verses and violent articles, warning men of\\nthis deluge of barbaric denial. But he seemed to be getting no\\nnearer his enemy, and, what was worse, no nearer a living. As he\\npaced the Thames embankment, bitterly biting a cheap cigar and\\nbrooding on the advance of Anarchy, there was no anarchist with\\na bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he. Indeed, he\\nalways felt that Government stood alone and desperate, with its\\nback to the wall. He was too quixotic to have cared for it\\notherwise.\\n\\nHe walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset. The red\\nriver reflected the red sky, and they both reflected his anger. The\\nsky, indeed, was so swarthy, and the light on the river relatively\\nso lurid, that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the\\nsunset it mirrored. It looked like a stream of literal fire winding\\nunder the vast caverns of a subterranean country.\\n\\nSyme was shabby in those days. He wore an old-fashioned black\\nchimney-pot hat; he was wrapped in a yet more old-fashioned cloak,\\nblack and ragged; and the combination gave him the look of the\\nearly villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton. Also his yellow beard\\nand hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long\\nafterwards, cut and pointed, on the lawns of Saffron Park. A long,\\nlean, black cigar, bought in Soho for twopence, stood out from\\nbetween his tightened teeth, and altogether he looked a very\\nsatisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a\\nholy war. Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke\\nto him, and said \"Good evening.\"\\n\\nSyme, at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity, seemed stung by\\nthe mere stolidity of the automatic official, a mere bulk of blue\\nin the twilight.\\n\\n\"A good evening is it?\" he said sharply. \"You fellows would call\\nthe end of the world a good evening. Look at that bloody red sun\\nand that bloody river! I tell you that if that were literally human\\nblood, spilt and shining, you would still be standing here as solid\\nas ever, looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could\\nmove on. You policemen are cruel to the poor, but I could forgive\\nyou even your cruelty if it were not for your calm.\"\\n\\n\"If we are calm,\" replied the policeman, \"it is the calm of\\norganised resistance.\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Syme, staring.\\n\\n\"The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle,\" pursued the\\npoliceman. \"The composure of an army is the anger of a nation.\"\\n\\n\"Good God, the Board Schools!\" said Syme. \"Is this undenominational\\neducation?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the policeman sadly, \"I never had any of those\\nadvantages. The Board Schools came after my time. What education\\nI had was very rough and old-fashioned, I am afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you have it?\" asked Syme, wondering.\\n\\n\"Oh, at Harrow,\" said the policeman\\n\\nThe class sympathies which, false as they are, are the truest\\nthings in so many men, broke out of Syme before he could control\\nthem.\\n\\n\"But, good Lord, man,\" he said, \"you oughtn\\'t to be a policeman!\"\\n\\nThe policeman sighed and shook his head.\\n\\n\"I know,\" he said solemnly, \"I know I am not worthy.\"\\n\\n\"But why did you join the police?\" asked Syme with rude curiosity.\\n\\n\"For much the same reason that you abused the police,\" replied the\\nother. \"I found that there was a special opening in the service for\\nthose whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the\\naberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and\\nexcusable, though excessive, outbreaks of the human will. I trust\\nI make myself clear.\"\\n\\n\"If you mean that you make your opinion clear,\" said Syme, \"I\\nsuppose you do. But as for making yourself clear, it is the last\\nthing you do. How comes a man like you to be talking philosophy\\nin a blue helmet on the Thames embankment?\\n\\n\"You have evidently not heard of the latest development in our\\npolice system,\" replied the other. \"I am not surprised at it. We\\nare keeping it rather dark from the educated class, because that\\nclass contains most of our enemies. But you seem to be exactly in\\nthe right frame of mind. I think you might almost join us.\"\\n\\n\"Join you in what?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"I will tell you,\" said the policeman slowly. \"This is the\\nsituation: The head of one of our departments, one of the most\\ncelebrated detectives in Europe, has long been of opinion that a\\npurely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very\\nexistence of civilisation. He is certain that the scientific and\\nartistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family\\nand the State. He has, therefore, formed a special corps of\\npolicemen, policemen who are also philosophers. It is their\\nbusiness to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy, not merely in\\na criminal but in a controversial sense. I am a democrat myself,\\nand I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of\\nordinary valour or virtue. But it would obviously be undesirable to\\nemploy the common policeman in an investigation which is also a\\nheresy hunt.\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity.\\n\\n\"What do you do, then?\" he said.\\n\\n\"The work of the philosophical policeman,\" replied the man in\\nblue, \"is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary\\ndetective. The ordinary detective goes to pot-houses to arrest\\nthieves; we go to artistic tea-parties to detect pessimists. The\\nordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime\\nhas been committed. We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime\\nwill be committed. We have to trace the origin of those dreadful\\nthoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and\\nintellectual crime. We were only just in time to prevent the\\nassassination at Hartle pool, and that was entirely due to the fact\\nthat our Mr. Wilks (a smart young fellow) thoroughly understood a\\ntriolet.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean,\" asked Syme, \"that there is really as much connection\\nbetween crime and the modern intellect as all that?\"\\n\\n\"You are not sufficiently democratic,\" answered the policeman, \"but\\nyou were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment\\nof the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business. I tell you I am\\nsometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means\\nmerely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate. But this new\\nmovement of ours is a very different affair. We deny the snobbish\\nEnglish assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals.\\nWe remember the Roman Emperors. We remember the great poisoning\\nprinces of the Renaissance. We say that the dangerous criminal is\\nthe educated criminal. We say that the most dangerous criminal now\\nis the entirely lawless modern philosopher. Compared to him,\\nburglars and bigamists are essentially moral men; my heart goes out\\nto them. They accept the essential ideal of man; they merely seek\\nit wrongly. Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property\\nto become their property that they may more perfectly respect it.\\nBut philosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy\\nthe very idea of personal possession. Bigamists respect marriage,\\nor they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even\\nritualistic formality of bigamy. But philosophers despise marriage\\nas marriage. Murderers respect human life; they merely wish to\\nattain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the\\nsacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives. But\\nphilosophers hate life itself, their own as much as other\\npeople\\'s.\"\\n\\nSyme struck his hands together.\\n\\n\"How true that is,\" he cried. \"I have felt it from my boyhood, but\\nnever could state the verbal antithesis. The common criminal is a\\nbad man, but at least he is, as it were, a conditional good man.\\nHe says that if only a certain obstacle be removed--say a wealthy\\nuncle--he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise\\nGod. He is a reformer, but not an anarchist. He wishes to cleanse\\nthe edifice, but not to destroy it. But the evil philosopher is\\nnot trying to alter things, but to annihilate them. Yes, the\\nmodern world has retained all those parts of police work which are\\nreally oppressive and ignominious, the harrying of the poor, the\\nspying upon the unfortunate. It has given up its more dignified\\nwork, the punishment of powerful traitors the in the State and\\npowerful heresiarchs in the Church. The moderns say we must not\\npunish heretics. My only doubt is whether we have a right to\\npunish anybody else.\"\\n\\n\"But this is absurd!\" cried the policeman, clasping his hands with\\nan excitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume, \"but\\nit is intolerable! I don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, but you\\'re\\nwasting your life. You must, you shall, join our special army\\nagainst anarchy. Their armies are on our frontiers. Their bolt\\nis ready to fall. A moment more, and you may lose the glory of\\nworking with us, perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes\\nof the world.\"\\n\\n\"It is a chance not to be missed, certainly,\" assented Syme, \"but\\nstill I do not quite understand. I know as well as anybody that\\nthe modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little\\nmovements. But, beastly as they are, they generally have the one\\nmerit of disagreeing with each other. How can you talk of their\\nleading one army or hurling one bolt. What is this anarchy?\"\\n\\n\"Do not confuse it,\" replied the constable, \"with those chance\\ndynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland, which are really\\nthe outbreaks of oppressed, if mistaken, men. This is a vast\\nphilosophic movement, consisting of an outer and an inner ring.\\nYou might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring\\nthe priesthood. I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent\\nsection, the inner ring the supremely guilty section. The outer\\nring--the main mass of their supporters--are merely anarchists;\\nthat is, men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed\\nhuman happiness. They believe that all the evil results of human\\ncrime are the results of the system that has called it crime. They\\ndo not believe that the crime creates the punishment. They believe\\nthat the punishment has created the crime. They believe that if a\\nman seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless\\nas the flowers of spring. They believe that if a man picked a\\npocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good. These I call the\\ninnocent section.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Naturally, therefore, these people talk about \\'a happy time\\ncoming\\'; \\'the paradise of the future\\'; \\'mankind freed from the\\nbondage of vice and the bondage of virtue,\\' and so on. And so also\\nthe men of the inner circle speak--the sacred priesthood. They\\nalso speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future,\\nand of mankind freed at last. But in their mouths\"--and the\\npoliceman lowered his voice--\"in their mouths these happy phrases\\nhave a horrible meaning. They are under no illusions; they are too\\nintellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite\\nfree of original sin and the struggle. And they mean death. When\\nthey say that mankind shall be free at last, they mean that\\nmankind shall commit suicide. When they talk of a paradise without\\nright or wrong, they mean the grave.\\n\\nThey have but two objects, to destroy first humanity and then\\nthemselves. That is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols.\\nThe innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has\\nnot killed the king; but the high-priesthood are happy because it\\nhas killed somebody.\"\\n\\n\"How can I join you?\" asked Syme, with a sort of passion.\\n\\n\"I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment,\" said the\\npoliceman, \"as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence\\nof the chief of whom I have spoken. You should really come and see\\nhim. Or rather, I should not say see him, nobody ever sees him; but\\nyou can talk to him if you like.\"\\n\\n\"Telephone?\" inquired Syme, with interest.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the policeman placidly, \"he has a fancy for always\\nsitting in a pitch-dark room. He says it makes his thoughts\\nbrighter. Do come along.\"\\n\\nSomewhat dazed and considerably excited, Syme allowed himself to be\\nled to a side-door in the long row of buildings of Scotland Yard.\\nAlmost before he knew what he was doing, he had been passed through\\nthe hands of about four intermediate officials, and was suddenly\\nshown into a room, the abrupt blackness of which startled him like\\na blaze of light. It was not the ordinary darkness, in which forms\\ncan be faintly traced; it was like going suddenly stone-blind.\\n\\n\"Are you the new recruit?\" asked a heavy voice.\\n\\nAnd in some strange way, though there was not the shadow of a shape\\nin the gloom, Syme knew two things: first, that it came from a man\\nof massive stature; and second, that the man had his back to him.\\n\\n\"Are you the new recruit?\" said the invisible chief, who seemed to\\nhave heard all about it. \"All right. You are engaged.\"\\n\\nSyme, quite swept off his feet, made a feeble fight against this\\nirrevocable phrase.\\n\\n\"I really have no experience,\" he began.\\n\\n\"No one has any experience,\" said the other, \"of the Battle of\\nArmageddon.\"\\n\\n\"But I am really unfit--\"\\n\\n\"You are willing, that is enough,\" said the unknown.\\n\\n\"Well, really,\" said Syme, \"I don\\'t know any profession of which\\nmere willingness is the final test.\"\\n\\n\"I do,\" said the other--\"martyrs. I am condemning you to death.\\nGood day.\"\\n\\nThus it was that when Gabriel Syme came out again into the crimson\\nlight of evening, in his shabby black hat and shabby, lawless\\ncloak, he came out a member of the New Detective Corps for the\\nfrustration of the great conspiracy. Acting under the advice of his\\nfriend the policeman (who was professionally inclined to neatness),\\nhe trimmed his hair and beard, bought a good hat, clad himself in\\nan exquisite summer suit of light blue-grey, with a pale yellow\\nflower in the button-hole, and, in short, became that elegant and\\nrather insupportable person whom Gregory had first encountered in\\nthe little garden of Saffron Park. Before he finally left the\\npolice premises his friend provided him with a small blue card,\\non which was written, \"The Last Crusade,\" and a number, the sign\\nof his official authority. He put this carefully in his upper\\nwaistcoat pocket, lit a cigarette, and went forth to track and\\nfight the enemy in all the drawing-rooms of London. Where his\\nadventure ultimately led him we have already seen. At about\\nhalf-past one on a February night he found himself steaming in a\\nsmall tug up the silent Thames, armed with swordstick and revolver,\\nthe duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists.\\n\\nWhen Syme stepped out on to the steam-tug he had a singular\\nsensation of stepping out into something entirely new; not merely\\ninto the landscape of a new land, but even into the landscape of a\\nnew planet. This was mainly due to the insane yet solid decision of\\nthat evening, though partly also to an entire change in the weather\\nand the sky since he entered the little tavern some two hours\\nbefore. Every trace of the passionate plumage of the cloudy sunset\\nhad been swept away, and a naked moon stood in a naked sky. The\\nmoon was so strong and full that (by a paradox often to be noticed)\\nit seemed like a weaker sun. It gave, not the sense of bright\\nmoonshine, but rather of a dead daylight.\\n\\nOver the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural\\ndiscoloration, as of that disastrous twilight which Milton spoke\\nof as shed by the sun in eclipse; so that Syme fell easily into\\nhis first thought, that he was actually on some other and emptier\\nplanet, which circled round some sadder star. But the more he felt\\nthis glittering desolation in the moonlit land, the more his own\\nchivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire. Even the\\ncommon things he carried with him--the food and the brandy and the\\nloaded pistol--took on exactly that concrete and material poetry\\nwhich a child feels when he takes a gun upon a journey or a bun\\nwith him to bed. The sword-stick and the brandy-flask, though in\\nthemselves only the tools of morbid conspirators, became the\\nexpressions of his own more healthy romance. The sword-stick\\nbecame almost the sword of chivalry, and the brandy the wine of\\nthe stirrup-cup. For even the most dehumanised modern fantasies\\ndepend on some older and simpler figure; the adventures may be\\nmad, but the adventurer must be sane. The dragon without St.\\nGeorge would not even be grotesque. So this inhuman landscape was\\nonly imaginative by the presence of a man really human. To Syme\\'s\\nexaggerative mind the bright, bleak houses and terraces by the\\nThames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon. But even the\\nmoon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon.\\n\\nThe tug was worked by two men, and with much toil went\\ncomparatively slowly. The clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had\\ngone down by the time that they passed Battersea, and when they\\ncame under the enormous bulk of Westminster day had already begun\\nto break. It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead,\\nshowing bars of silver; and these had brightened like white fire\\nwhen the tug, changing its onward course, turned inward to a large\\nlanding stage rather beyond Charing Cross.\\n\\nThe great stones of the Embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic\\nas Syme looked up at them. They were big and black against the huge\\nwhite dawn. They made him feel that he was landing on the colossal\\nsteps of some Egyptian palace; and, indeed, the thing suited his\\nmood, for he was, in his own mind, mounting to attack the solid\\nthrones of horrible and heathen kings. He leapt out of the boat on\\nto one slimy step, and stood, a dark and slender figure, amid the\\nenormous masonry. The two men in the tug put her off again and\\nturned up stream. They had never spoken a word.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nTHE FEAST OF FEAR\\n\\nAT first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a\\npyramid; but before he reached the top he had realised that there\\nwas a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking\\nout across the river. As a figure he was quite conventional, clad\\nin a silk hat and frock-coat of the more formal type of fashion;\\nhe had a red flower in his buttonhole. As Syme drew nearer to him\\nstep by step, he did not even move a hair; and Syme could come\\nclose enough to notice even in the dim, pale morning light that\\nhis face was long, pale and intellectual, and ended in a small\\ntriangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin, all\\nelse being clean-shaven. This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere\\noversight; the rest of the face was of the type that is best\\nshaven--clear-cut, ascetic, and in its way noble. Syme drew closer\\nand closer, noting all this, and still the figure did not stir.\\n\\nAt first an instinct had told Syme that this was the man whom he\\nwas meant to meet. Then, seeing that the man made no sign, he had\\nconcluded that he was not. And now again he had come back to a\\ncertainty that the man had something to do with his mad adventure.\\nFor the man remained more still than would have been natural if a\\nstranger had come so close. He was as motionless as a wax-work,\\nand got on the nerves somewhat in the same way. Syme looked again\\nand again at the pale, dignified and delicate face, and the face\\nstill looked blankly across the river. Then he took out of his\\npocket the note from Buttons proving his election, and put it\\nbefore that sad and beautiful face. Then the man smiled, and his\\nsmile was a shock, for it was all on one side, going up in the\\nright cheek and down in the left.\\n\\nThere was nothing, rationally speaking, to scare anyone about\\nthis. Many people have this nervous trick of a crooked smile, and\\nin many it is even attractive. But in all Syme\\'s circumstances,\\nwith the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the\\ngreat dripping stones, there was something unnerving in it.\\n\\nThere was the silent river and the silent man, a man of even\\nclassic face. And there was the last nightmare touch that his\\nsmile suddenly went wrong.\\n\\nThe spasm of smile was instantaneous, and the man\\'s face dropped\\nat once into its harmonious melancholy. He spoke without further\\nexplanation or inquiry, like a man speaking to an old colleague.\\n\\n\"If we walk up towards Leicester Square,\" he said, \"we shall just\\nbe in time for breakfast. Sunday always insists on an early\\nbreakfast. Have you had any sleep?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Nor have I,\" answered the man in an ordinary tone. \"I shall try to\\nget to bed after breakfast.\"\\n\\nHe spoke with casual civility, but in an utterly dead voice that\\ncontradicted the fanaticism of his face. It seemed almost as if all\\nfriendly words were to him lifeless conveniences, and that his only\\nlife was hate. After a pause the man spoke again.\\n\\n\"Of course, the Secretary of the branch told you everything that\\ncan be told. But the one thing that can never be told is the last\\nnotion of the President, for his notions grow like a tropical\\nforest. So in case you don\\'t know, I\\'d better tell you that he is\\ncarrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing\\nourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now. Originally,\\nof course, we met in a cell underground, just as your branch does.\\nThen Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant.\\nHe said that if you didn\\'t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out.\\nWell, he is the only man on earth, I know; but sometimes I really\\nthink that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age. For\\nnow we flaunt ourselves before the public. We have our breakfast on\\na balcony--on a balcony, if you please--overlooking Leicester\\nSquare.\"\\n\\n\"And what do the people say?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite simple what they say,\" answered his guide.\\n\\n\"They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are\\nanarchists.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me a very clever idea,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Clever! God blast your impudence! Clever!\" cried out the other in\\na sudden, shrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his\\ncrooked smile. \"When you\\'ve seen Sunday for a split second you\\'ll\\nleave off calling him clever.\"\\n\\nWith this they emerged out of a narrow street, and saw the early\\nsunlight filling Leicester Square. It will never be known, I\\nsuppose, why this square itself should look so alien and in some\\nways so continental. It will never be known whether it was the\\nforeign look that attracted the foreigners or the foreigners who\\ngave it the foreign look. But on this particular morning the effect\\nseemed singularly bright and clear. Between the open square and the\\nsunlit leaves and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the\\nAlhambra, it looked the replica of some French or even Spanish\\npublic place. And this effect increased in Syme the sensation,\\nwhich in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure, the\\neerie sensation of having strayed into a new world. As a fact, he\\nhad bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since he was a\\nboy. But as he turned that corner, and saw the trees and the\\nMoorish cupolas, he could have sworn that he was turning into an\\nunknown Place de something or other in some foreign town.\\n\\nAt one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a\\nprosperous but quiet hotel, the bulk of which belonged to a street\\nbehind. In the wall there was one large French window, probably\\nthe window of a large coffee-room; and outside this window, almost\\nliterally overhanging the square, was a formidably buttressed\\nbalcony, big enough to contain a dining-table. In fact, it did\\ncontain a dining-table, or more strictly a breakfast-table; and\\nround the breakfast-table, glowing in the sunlight and evident to\\nthe street, were a group of noisy and talkative men, all dressed\\nin the insolence of fashion, with white waistcoats and expensive\\nbutton-holes. Some of their jokes could almost be heard across the\\nsquare. Then the grave Secretary gave his unnatural smile, and Syme\\nknew that this boisterous breakfast party was the secret conclave\\nof the European Dynamiters.\\n\\nThen, as Syme continued to stare at them, he saw something that he\\nhad not seen before. He had not seen it literally because it was\\ntoo large to see. At the nearest end of the balcony, blocking up a\\ngreat part of the perspective, was the back of a great mountain of\\na man. When Syme had seen him, his first thought was that the\\nweight of him must break down the balcony of stone. His vastness\\ndid not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite\\nincredibly fat. This man was planned enormously in his original\\nproportions, like a statue carved deliberately as colossal. His\\nhead, crowned with white hair, as seen from behind looked bigger\\nthan a head ought to be. The ears that stood out from it looked\\nlarger than human ears. He was enlarged terribly to scale; and this\\nsense of size was so staggering, that when Syme saw him all the\\nother figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish.\\nThey were still sitting there as before with their flowers and\\nfrock-coats, but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining\\nfive children to tea.\\n\\nAs Syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel, a\\nwaiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head.\\n\\n\"The gentlemen are up there, sare,\" he said. \"They do talk and they\\ndo laugh at what they talk. They do say they will throw bombs at ze\\nking.\"\\n\\nAnd the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm, much\\npleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs.\\n\\nThe two men mounted the stairs in silence.\\n\\nSyme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who\\nalmost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom\\nthe others stood in awe. He knew it was so, with an unaccountable\\nbut instantaneous certainty. Syme, indeed, was one of those men who\\nare open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a\\ndegree a little dangerous to mental health. Utterly devoid of fear\\nin physical dangers, he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell\\nof spiritual evil. Twice already that night little unmeaning things\\nhad peeped out at him almost pruriently, and given him a sense of\\ndrawing nearer and nearer to the head-quarters of hell. And this\\nsense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great President.\\n\\nThe form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy. As he walked\\nacross the inner room towards the balcony, the large face of Sunday\\ngrew larger and larger; and Syme was gripped with a fear that when\\nhe was quite close the face would be too big to be possible, and\\nthat he would scream aloud. He remembered that as a child he would\\nnot look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum, because it\\nwas a face, and so large.\\n\\nBy an effort, braver than that of leaping over a cliff, he went to\\nan empty seat at the breakfast-table and sat down. The men greeted\\nhim with good-humoured raillery as if they had always known him. He\\nsobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and\\nsolid, shining coffee-pot; then he looked again at Sunday. His face\\nwas very large, but it was still possible to humanity.\\n\\nIn the presence of the President the whole company looked\\nsufficiently commonplace; nothing about them caught the eye at\\nfirst, except that by the President\\'s caprice they had been dressed\\nup with a festive respectability, which gave the meal the look of a\\nwedding breakfast. One man indeed stood out at even a superficial\\nglance. He at least was the common or garden Dynamiter. He wore,\\nindeed, the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform\\nof the occasion; but out of this collar there sprang a head quite\\nunmanageable and quite unmistakable, a bewildering bush of brown\\nhair and beard that almost obscured the eyes like those of a Skye\\nterrier. But the eyes did look out of the tangle, and they were the\\nsad eyes of some Russian serf. The effect of this figure was not\\nterrible like that of the President, but it had every diablerie\\nthat can come from the utterly grotesque. If out of that stiff tie\\nand collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog, it\\ncould not have been a more idiotic contrast.\\n\\nThe man\\'s name, it seemed, was Gogol; he was a Pole, and in this\\ncircle of days he was called Tuesday. His soul and speech were\\nincurably tragic; he could not force himself to play the\\nprosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by President Sunday.\\nAnd, indeed, when Syme came in the President, with that daring\\ndisregard of public suspicion which was his policy, was actually\\nchaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces.\\n\\n\"Our friend Tuesday,\" said the President in a deep voice at once\\nof quietude and volume, \"our friend Tuesday doesn\\'t seem to grasp\\nthe idea. He dresses up like a gentleman, but he seems to be too\\ngreat a soul to behave like one. He insists on the ways of the\\nstage conspirator. Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top\\nhat and a frock-coat, no one need know that he is an anarchist.\\nBut if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock-coat, and then\\ngoes about on his hands and knees--well, he may attract attention.\\nThat\\'s what Brother Gogol does. He goes about on his hands and\\nknees with such inexhaustible diplomacy, that by this time he\\nfinds it quite difficult to walk upright.\"\\n\\n\"I am not good at goncealment,\" said Gogol sulkily, with a thick\\nforeign accent; \"I am not ashamed of the cause.\"\\n\\n\"Yes you are, my boy, and so is the cause of you,\" said the\\nPresident good-naturedly. \"You hide as much as anybody; but you\\ncan\\'t do it, you see, you\\'re such an ass! You try to combine two\\ninconsistent methods. When a householder finds a man under his\\nbed, he will probably pause to note the circumstance. But if he\\nfinds a man under his bed in a top hat, you will agree with me, \\nmy dear Tuesday, that he is not likely even to forget it. Now\\nwhen you were found under Admiral Biffin\\'s bed--\"\\n\\n\"I am not good at deception,\" said Tuesday gloomily, flushing.\\n\\n\"Right, my boy, right,\" said the President with a ponderous\\nheartiness, \"you aren\\'t good at anything.\"\\n\\nWhile this stream of conversation continued, Syme was looking\\nmore steadily at the men around him. As he did so, he gradually\\nfelt all his sense of something spiritually queer return.\\n\\nHe had thought at first that they were all of common stature and\\ncostume, with the evident exception of the hairy Gogol. But as he\\nlooked at the others, he began to see in each of them exactly what\\nhe had seen in the man by the river, a demoniac detail somewhere.\\nThat lop-sided laugh, which would suddenly disfigure the fine\\nface of his original guide, was typical of all these types. Each\\nman had something about him, perceived perhaps at the tenth or\\ntwentieth glance, which was not normal, and which seemed hardly\\nhuman. The only metaphor he could think of was this, that they\\nall looked as men of fashion and presence would look, with the\\nadditional twist given in a false and curved mirror.\\n\\nOnly the individual examples will express this half-concealed\\neccentricity. Syme\\'s original cicerone bore the title of Monday;\\nhe was the Secretary of the Council, and his twisted smile was\\nregarded with more terror than anything, except the President\\'s\\nhorrible, happy laughter. But now that Syme had more space and\\nlight to observe him, there were other touches. His fine face\\nwas so emaciated, that Syme thought it must be wasted with some\\ndisease; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied\\nthis. It was no physical ill that troubled him. His eyes were\\nalive with intellectual torture, as if pure thought was pain.\\n\\nHe was typical of each of the tribe; each man was subtly and\\ndifferently wrong. Next to him sat Tuesday, the tousle-headed\\nGogol, a man more obviously mad. Next was Wednesday, a certain\\nMarquis de St. Eustache, a sufficiently characteristic figure. The\\nfirst few glances found nothing unusual about him, except that he\\nwas the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as if\\nthey were really his own. He had a black French beard cut square\\nand a black English frock-coat cut even squarer. But Syme,\\nsensitive to such things, felt somehow that the man carried a rich\\natmosphere with him, a rich atmosphere that suffocated. It\\nreminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in\\nthe darker poems of Byron and Poe. With this went a sense of his\\nbeing clad, not in lighter colours, but in softer materials; his\\nblack seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him, as\\nif it were compounded of profound colour. His black coat looked as\\nif it were only black by being too dense a purple. His black beard\\nlooked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue. And in\\nthe gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed\\nsensual and scornful. Whatever he was he was not a Frenchman; he\\nmight be a Jew; he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart\\nof the East. In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures\\nshowing tyrants hunting, you may see just those almond eyes, those\\nblue-black beards, those cruel, crimson lips.\\n\\nThen came Syme, and next a very old man, Professor de Worms, who\\nstill kept the chair of Friday, though every day it was expected\\nthat his death would leave it empty. Save for his intellect, he was\\nin the last dissolution of senile decay. His face was as grey as\\nhis long grey beard, his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a\\nfurrow of mild despair. In no other case, not even that of Gogol,\\ndid the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more\\npainful contrast. For the red flower in his button-hole showed up\\nagainst a face that was literally discoloured like lead; the whole\\nhideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes\\nupon a corpse. When he rose or sat down, which was with long labour\\nand peril, something worse was expressed than mere weakness,\\nsomething indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene.\\nIt did not express decrepitude merely, but corruption. Another\\nhateful fancy crossed Syme\\'s quivering mind. He could not help\\nthinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off.\\n\\nRight at the end sat the man called Saturday, the simplest and the\\nmost baffling of all. He was a short, square man with a dark,\\nsquare face clean-shaven, a medical practitioner going by the name\\nof Bull. He had that combination of savoir-faire with a sort of\\nwell-groomed coarseness which is not uncommon in young doctors. He\\ncarried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease, and he\\nmostly wore a set smile. There was nothing whatever odd about him,\\nexcept that he wore a pair of dark, almost opaque spectacles. It\\nmay have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone\\nbefore, but those black discs were dreadful to Syme; they reminded\\nhim of half-remembered ugly tales, of some story about pennies\\nbeing put on the eyes of the dead. Syme\\'s eye always caught the\\nblack glasses and the blind grin. Had the dying Professor worn\\nthem, or even the pale Secretary, they would have been appropriate.\\nBut on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma. They\\ntook away the key of the face. You could not tell what his smile or\\nhis gravity meant. Partly from this, and partly because he had a\\nvulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to Syme\\nthat he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men. Syme even\\nhad the thought that his eyes might be covered up because they were\\ntoo frightful to see.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nTHE EXPOSURE\\n\\nSUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world. Again\\nand again Syme strove to pull together his common sense in their\\npresence. Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were\\nsubjective, that he was only looking at ordinary men, one of whom\\nwas old, another nervous, another short-sighted. The sense of an\\nunnatural symbolism always settled back on him again. Each figure\\nseemed to be, somehow, on the borderland of things, just as their\\ntheory was on the borderland of thought. He knew that each one of\\nthese men stood at the extreme end, so to speak, of some wild road\\nof reasoning. He could only fancy, as in some old-world fable,\\nthat if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find\\nsomething--say a tree--that was more or less than a tree, a tree\\npossessed by a spirit; and that if he went east to the end of the\\nworld he would find something else that was not wholly itself--a\\ntower, perhaps, of which the very shape was wicked. So these\\nfigures seemed to stand up, violent and unaccountable, against an\\nultimate horizon, visions from the verge. The ends of the earth\\nwere closing in.\\n\\nTalk had been going on steadily as he took in the scene; and not\\nthe least of the contrasts of that bewildering breakfast-table was\\nthe contrast between the easy and unobtrusive tone of talk and its\\nterrible purport. They were deep in the discussion of an actual and\\nimmediate plot. The waiter downstairs had spoken quite correctly\\nwhen he said that they were talking about bombs and kings. Only\\nthree days afterwards the Czar was to meet the President of the\\nFrench Republic in Paris, and over their bacon and eggs upon their\\nsunny balcony these beaming gentlemen had decided how both should\\ndie. Even the instrument was chosen; the black-bearded Marquis, it\\nappeared, was to carry the bomb.\\n\\nOrdinarily speaking, the proximity of this positive and objective\\ncrime would have sobered Syme, and cured him of all his merely\\nmystical tremors. He would have thought of nothing but the need of\\nsaving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with\\niron and roaring gas. But the truth was that by this time he had\\nbegun to feel a third kind of fear, more piercing and practical\\nthan either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility. Very\\nsimply, he had no fear to spare for the French President or the\\nCzar; he had begun to fear for himself. Most of the talkers took\\nlittle heed of him, debating now with their faces closer together,\\nand almost uniformly grave, save when for an instant the smile of\\nthe Secretary ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning\\nruns aslant across the sky. But there was one persistent thing\\nwhich first troubled Syme and at last terrified him. The President\\nwas always looking at him, steadily, and with a great and baffling\\ninterest. The enormous man was quite quiet, but his blue eyes\\nstood out of his head. And they were always fixed on Syme.\\n\\nSyme felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony. When the\\nPresident\\'s eyes were on him he felt as if he were made of glass.\\nHe had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and\\nextraordinary way Sunday had found out that he was a spy. He\\nlooked over the edge of the balcony, and saw a policeman, standing\\nabstractedly just beneath, staring at the bright railings and the\\nsunlit trees.\\n\\nThen there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment\\nhim for many days. In the presence of these powerful and repulsive\\nmen, who were the princes of anarchy, he had almost forgotten the\\nfrail and fanciful figure of the poet Gregory, the mere aesthete of\\nanarchism. He even thought of him now with an old kindness, as if\\nthey had played together when children. But he remembered that he\\nwas still tied to Gregory by a great promise. He had promised never\\nto do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of\\ndoing. He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to\\nthat policeman. He took his cold hand off the cold stone\\nbalustrade. His soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision. He\\nhad only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous\\nsociety, and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square\\nbeneath him. He had, on the other hand, only to keep his antiquated\\nhonour, and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great\\nenemy of mankind, whose very intellect was a torture-chamber.\\nWhenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable\\npoliceman, a pillar of common sense and common order. Whenever he\\nlooked back at the breakfast-table he saw the President still\\nquietly studying him with big, unbearable eyes.\\n\\nIn all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that\\nnever crossed his mind. First, it never occurred to him to doubt\\nthat the President and his Council could crush him if he continued\\nto stand alone. The place might be public, the project might seem\\nimpossible. But Sunday was not the man who would carry himself\\nthus easily without having, somehow or somewhere, set open his\\niron trap. Either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident,\\nby hypnotism or by fire from hell, Sunday could certainly strike\\nhim. If he defied the man he was probably dead, either struck\\nstiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent\\nailment. If he called in the police promptly, arrested everyone,\\ntold all, and set against them the whole energy of England, he\\nwould probably escape; certainly not otherwise. They were a\\nbalconyful of gentlemen overlooking a bright and busy square; but\\nhe felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boatful of\\narmed pirates overlooking an empty sea.\\n\\nThere was a second thought that never came to him. It never\\noccurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy. Many\\nmoderns, inured to a weak worship of intellect and force, might\\nhave wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great\\npersonality. They might have called Sunday the super-man. If any\\nsuch creature be conceivable, he looked, indeed, somewhat like it,\\nwith his earth-shaking abstraction, as of a stone statue walking.\\nHe might have been called something above man, with his large\\nplans, which were too obvious to be detected, with his large face,\\nwhich was too frank to be understood. But this was a kind of\\nmodern meanness to which Syme could not sink even in his extreme\\nmorbidity. Like any man, he was coward enough to fear great force;\\nbut he was not quite coward enough to admire it.\\n\\nThe men were eating as they talked, and even in this they were\\ntypical. Dr. Bull and the Marquis ate casually and conventionally\\nof the best things on the table--cold pheasant or Strasbourg pie.\\nBut the Secretary was a vegetarian, and he spoke earnestly of the\\nprojected murder over half a raw tomato and three quarters of a\\nglass of tepid water. The old Professor had such slops as suggested\\na sickening second childhood. And even in this President Sunday\\npreserved his curious predominance of mere mass. For he ate like\\ntwenty men; he ate incredibly, with a frightful freshness of\\nappetite, so that it was like watching a sausage factory. Yet\\ncontinually, when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a\\nquart of coffee, he would be found with his great head on one side\\nstaring at Syme.\\n\\n\"I have often wondered,\" said the Marquis, taking a great bite out\\nof a slice of bread and jam, \"whether it wouldn\\'t be better for me\\nto do it with a knife. Most of the best things have been brought\\noff with a knife. And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into\\na French President and wriggle it round.\"\\n\\n\"You are wrong,\" said the Secretary, drawing his black brows\\ntogether. \"The knife was merely the expression of the old personal\\nquarrel with a personal tyrant. Dynamite is not only our best tool,\\nbut our best symbol. It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense\\nof the prayers of the Christians. It expands; it only destroys\\nbecause it broadens; even so, thought only destroys because it\\nbroadens. A man\\'s brain is a bomb,\" he cried out, loosening\\nsuddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with\\nviolence. \"My brain feels like a bomb, night and day. It must\\nexpand! It must expand! A man\\'s brain must expand, if it breaks up\\nthe universe.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want the universe broken up just yet,\" drawled the\\nMarquis. \"I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die.\\nI thought of one yesterday in bed.\"\\n\\n\"No, if the only end of the thing is nothing,\" said Dr. Bull with\\nhis sphinx-like smile, \"it hardly seems worth doing.\"\\n\\nThe old Professor was staring at the ceiling with dull eyes.\\n\\n\"Every man knows in his heart,\" he said, \"that nothing is worth\\ndoing.\"\\n\\nThere was a singular silence, and then the Secretary said--\\n\\n\"We are wandering, however, from the point. The only question is\\nhow Wednesday is to strike the blow. I take it we should all agree\\nwith the original notion of a bomb. As to the actual arrangements,\\nI should suggest that tomorrow morning he should go first of all\\nto--\"\\n\\nThe speech was broken off short under a vast shadow. President\\nSunday had risen to his feet, seeming to fill the sky above them.\\n\\n\"Before we discuss that,\" he said in a small, quiet voice, \"let us\\ngo into a private room. I have something vent particular to say.\"\\n\\nSyme stood up before any of the others. The instant of choice had\\ncome at last, the pistol was at his head. On the pavement before\\nhe could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp, for the morning,\\nthough bright, was cold.\\n\\nA barrel-organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a\\njovial tune. Syme stood up taut, as if it had been a bugle before\\nthe battle. He found himself filled with a supernatural courage\\nthat came from nowhere. That jingling music seemed full of the\\nvivacity, the vulgarity, and the irrational valour of the poor, who\\nin all those unclean streets were all clinging to the decencies and\\nthe charities of Christendom. His youthful prank of being a\\npoliceman had faded from his mind; he did not think of himself as\\nthe representative of the corps of gentlemen turned into fancy\\nconstables, or of the old eccentric who lived in the dark room.\\nBut he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and\\nkindly people in the street, who every day marched into battle to\\nthe music of the barrel-organ. And this high pride in being human\\nhad lifted him unaccountably to an infinite height above the\\nmonstrous men around him. For an instant, at least, he looked down\\nupon all their sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle\\nof the commonplace. He felt towards them all that unconscious and\\nelementary superiority that a brave man feels over powerful beasts\\nor a wise man over powerful errors. He knew that he had neither the\\nintellectual nor the physical strength of President Sunday; but in\\nthat moment he minded it no more than the fact that he had not the\\nmuscles of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinoceros. All was\\nswallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong\\nand that the barrel-organ was right. There clanged in his mind that\\nunanswerable and terrible truism in the song of Roland--\\n\\n\"Pagens ont tort et Chretiens ont droit.\"\\n\\nwhich in the old nasal French has the clang and groan of great\\niron. This liberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness\\nwent with a quite clear decision to embrace death. If the people of\\nthe barrel-organ could keep their old-world obligations, so could\\nhe. This very pride in keeping his word was that he was keeping it\\nto miscreants. It was his last triumph over these lunatics to go\\ndown into their dark room and die for something that they could not\\neven understand. The barrel-organ seemed to give the marching tune\\nwith the energy and the mingled noises of a whole orchestra; and he\\ncould hear deep and rolling, under all the trumpets of the pride of\\nlife, the drums of the pride of death.\\n\\nThe conspirators were already filing through the open window and\\ninto the rooms behind. Syme went last, outwardly calm, but with all\\nhis brain and body throbbing with romantic rhythm. The President\\nled them down an irregular side stair, such as might be used by\\nservants, and into a dim, cold, empty room, with a table and\\nbenches, like an abandoned boardroom. When they were all in, he\\nclosed and locked the door.\\n\\nThe first to speak was Gogol, the irreconcilable, who seemed\\nbursting with inarticulate grievance.\\n\\n\"Zso! Zso!\" he cried, with an obscure excitement, his heavy Polish\\naccent becoming almost impenetrable. \"You zay you nod \\'ide. You zay\\nyou show himselves. It is all nuzzinks. Ven you vant talk\\nimportance you run yourselves in a dark box!\"\\n\\nThe President seemed to take the foreigner\\'s incoherent satire with\\nentire good humour.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t get hold of it yet, Gogol,\" he said in a fatherly way.\\n\"When once they have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they\\nwill not care where we go afterwards. If we had come here first, we\\nshould have had the whole staff at the keyhole. You don\\'t seem to\\nknow anything about mankind.\"\\n\\n\"I die for zem,\" cried the Pole in thick excitement, \"and I slay\\nzare oppressors. I care not for these games of gonzealment. I would\\nzmite ze tyrant in ze open square.\"\\n\\n\"I see, I see,\" said the President, nodding kindly as he seated\\nhimself at the top of a long table. \"You die for mankind first, and\\nthen you get up and smite their oppressors. So that\\'s all right.\\nAnd now may I ask you to control your beautiful sentiments, and sit\\ndown with the other gentlemen at this table. For the first time\\nthis morning something intelligent is going to be said.\"\\n\\nSyme, with the perturbed promptitude he had shown since the\\noriginal summons, sat down first. Gogol sat down last, grumbling\\nin his brown beard about gombromise. No one except Syme seemed to\\nhave any notion of the blow that was about to fall. As for him,\\nhe had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the\\nintention, at any rate, of making a good speech.\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" said the President, suddenly rising, \"we have spun out\\nthis farce long enough. I have called you down here to tell you\\nsomething so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs\\n(long inured to our levities) might hear some new seriousness in\\nmy voice. Comrades, we were discussing plans and naming places. I\\npropose, before saying anything else, that those plans and places\\nshould not be voted by this meeting, but should be left wholly in\\nthe control of some one reliable member. I suggest Comrade\\nSaturday, Dr. Bull.\"\\n\\nThey all stared at him; then they all started in their seats, for\\nthe next words, though not loud, had a living and sensational\\nemphasis. Sunday struck the table.\\n\\n\"Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this\\nmeeting. Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be\\nmentioned in this company.\"\\n\\nSunday had spent his life in astonishing his followers; but it\\nseemed as if he had never really astonished them until now. They\\nall moved feverishly in their seats, except Syme. He sat stiff in\\nhis, with his hand in his pocket, and on the handle of his loaded\\nrevolver. When the attack on him came he would sell his life dear.\\nHe would find out at least if the President was mortal.\\n\\nSunday went on smoothly--\\n\\n\"You will probably understand that there is only one possible\\nmotive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom.\\nStrangers overhearing us matters nothing. They assume that we\\nare joking. But what would matter, even unto death, is this,\\nthat there should be one actually among us who is not of us,\\nwho knows our grave purpose, but does not share it, who--\"\\n\\nThe Secretary screamed out suddenly like a woman.\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be!\" he cried, leaping. \"There can\\'t--\"\\n\\nThe President flapped his large flat hand on the table like the\\nfin of some huge fish.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said slowly, \"there is a spy in this room. There is a\\ntraitor at this table. I will waste no more words. His name--\"\\n\\nSyme half rose from his seat, his finger firm on the trigger.\\n\\n\"His name is Gogol,\" said the President. \"He is that hairy humbug\\nover there who pretends to be a Pole.\"\\n\\nGogol sprang to his feet, a pistol in each hand. With the same\\nflash three men sprang at his throat. Even the Professor made\\nan effort to rise. But Syme saw little of the scene, for he was\\nblinded with a beneficent darkness; he had sunk down into his\\nseat shuddering, in a palsy of passionate relief.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nTHE UNACCOUNTABLE CONDUCT OF PROFESSOR DE WORMS\\n\\n\"SIT down!\" said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in\\nhis life, a voice that made men drop drawn swords.\\n\\nThe three who had risen fell away from Gogol, and that equivocal\\nperson himself resumed his seat.\\n\\n\"Well, my man,\" said the President briskly, addressing him as one\\naddresses a total stranger, \"will you oblige me by putting your\\nhand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have\\nthere?\"\\n\\nThe alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair,\\nbut he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and\\npulled out a blue strip of card. When Syme saw it lying on the\\ntable, he woke up again to the world outside him. For although\\nthe card lay at the other extreme of the table, and he could read\\nnothing of the inscription on it, it bore a startling resemblance\\nto the blue card in his own pocket, the card which had been given\\nto him when he joined the anti-anarchist constabulary.\\n\\n\"Pathetic Slav,\" said the President, \"tragic child of Poland, are\\nyou prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in\\nthis company--shall we say de trop?\"\\n\\n\"Right oh!\" said the late Gogol. It made everyone jump to hear a\\nclear, commercial and somewhat cockney voice coming out of that\\nforest of foreign hair. It was irrational, as if a Chinaman had\\nsuddenly spoken with a Scotch accent.\\n\\n\"I gather that you fully understand your position,\" said Sunday.\\n\\n\"You bet,\" answered the Pole. \"I see it\\'s a fair cop. All I say is,\\nI don\\'t believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did\\nhis.\"\\n\\n\"I concede the point,\" said Sunday. \"I believe your own accent to\\nbe inimitable, though I shall practise it in my bath. Do you mind\\nleaving your beard with your card?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit,\" answered Gogol; and with one finger he ripped off the\\nwhole of his shaggy head-covering, emerging with thin red hair and\\na pale, pert face. \"It was hot,\" he added.\\n\\n\"I will do you the justice to say,\" said Sunday, not without a sort\\nof brutal admiration, \"that you seem to have kept pretty cool under\\nit. Now listen to me. I like you. The consequence is that it would\\nannoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you\\nhad died in torments. Well, if you ever tell the police or any\\nhuman soul about us, I shall have that two and a half minutes of\\ndiscomfort. On your discomfort I will not dwell. Good day. Mind the\\nstep.\"\\n\\nThe red-haired detective who had masqueraded as Gogol rose to his\\nfeet without a word, and walked out of the room with an air of\\nperfect nonchalance. Yet the astonished Syme was able to realise\\nthat this ease was suddenly assumed; for there was a slight stumble\\noutside the door, which showed that the departing detective had not\\nminded the step.\\n\\n\"Time is flying,\" said the President in his gayest manner, after\\nglancing at his watch, which like everything about him seemed\\nbigger than it ought to be. \"I must go off at once; I have to\\ntake the chair at a Humanitarian meeting.\"\\n\\nThe Secretary turned to him with working eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Would it not be better,\" he said a little sharply, \"to discuss\\nfurther the details of our project, now that the spy has left us?\"\\n\\n\"No, I think not,\" said the President with a yawn like an\\nunobtrusive earthquake. \"Leave it as it is. Let Saturday settle\\nit. I must be off. Breakfast here next Sunday.\"\\n\\nBut the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves\\nof the Secretary. He was one of those men who are conscientious\\neven in crime.\\n\\n\"I must protest, President, that the thing is irregular,\" he said.\\n\"It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be\\ndebated in full council. Of course, I fully appreciate your\\nforethought when in the actual presence of a traitor--\"\\n\\n\"Secretary,\" said the President seriously, \"if you\\'d take your head\\nhome and boil it for a turnip it might be useful. I can\\'t say. But\\nit might.\\n\\nThe Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger.\\n\\n\"I really fail to understand--\" he began in high offense.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, that\\'s it,\" said the President, nodding a great many\\ntimes. \"That\\'s where you fail right enough. You fail to understand.\\nWhy, you dancing donkey,\" he roared, rising, \"you didn\\'t want to be\\noverheard by a spy, didn\\'t you? How do you know you aren\\'t\\noverheard now?\"\\n\\nAnd with these words he shouldered his way out of the room, shaking\\nwith incomprehensible scorn.\\n\\nFour of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent\\nglimmering of his meaning. Syme alone had even a glimmering, and\\nsuch as it was it froze him to the bone. If the last words of the\\nPresident meant anything, they meant that he had not after all\\npassed unsuspected. They meant that while Sunday could not denounce\\nhim like Gogol, he still could not trust him like the others.\\n\\nThe other four got to their feet grumbling more or less, and betook\\nthemselves elsewhere to find lunch, for it was already well past\\nmidday. The Professor went last, very slowly and painfully. Syme\\nsat long after the rest had gone, revolving his strange position.\\nHe had escaped a thunderbolt, but he was still under a cloud. At\\nlast he rose and made his way out of the hotel into Leicester\\nSquare. The bright, cold day had grown increasingly colder, and\\nwhen he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes\\nof snow. While he still carried the sword-stick and the rest of\\nGregory\\'s portable luggage, he had thrown the cloak down and left\\nit somewhere, perhaps on the steam-tug, perhaps on the balcony.\\nHoping, therefore, that the snow-shower might be slight, he stepped\\nback out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway\\nof a small and greasy hair-dresser\\'s shop, the front window of\\nwhich was empty, except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress.\\n\\nSnow, however, began to thicken and fall fast; and Syme, having\\nfound one glance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his\\nspirits, stared out instead into the white and empty street. He was\\nconsiderably astonished to see, standing quite still outside the\\nshop and staring into the window, a man. His top hat was loaded\\nwith snow like the hat of Father Christmas, the white drift was\\nrising round his boots and ankles; but it seemed as if nothing\\ncould tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax\\ndoll in dirty evening dress. That any human being should stand in\\nsuch weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient\\nwonder to Syme; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal\\nshock; for he realised that the man standing there was the\\nparalytic old Professor de Worms. It scarcely seemed the place for\\na person of his years and infirmities.\\n\\nSyme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this\\ndehumanized brotherhood; but even he could not believe that the\\nProfessor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady. He\\ncould only suppose that the man\\'s malady (whatever it was) involved\\nsome momentary fits of rigidity or trance. He was not inclined,\\nhowever, to feel in this case any very compassionate concern. On\\nthe contrary, he rather congratulated himself that the Professor\\'s\\nstroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to\\nescape from him and leave him miles behind. For Syme thirsted first\\nand last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere, if only\\nfor an hour. Then he could collect his thoughts, formulate his\\npolicy, and decide finally whether he should or should not keep\\nfaith with Gregory.\\n\\nHe strolled away through the dancing snow, turned up two or three\\nstreets, down through two or three others, and entered a small Soho\\nrestaurant for lunch. He partook reflectively of four small and\\nquaint courses, drank half a bottle of red wine, and ended up over\\nblack coffee and a black cigar, still thinking. He had taken his\\nseat in the upper room of the restaurant, which was full of the\\nchink of knives and the chatter of foreigners. He remembered that\\nin old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly\\naliens were anarchists. He shuddered, remembering the real thing.\\nBut even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape. The wine,\\nthe common food, the familiar place, the faces of natural and\\ntalkative men, made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven\\nDays had been a bad dream; and although he knew it was nevertheless\\nan objective reality, it was at least a distant one. Tall houses\\nand populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the\\nshameful seven; he was free in free London, and drinking wine among\\nthe free. With a somewhat easier action, he took his hat and stick\\nand strolled down the stair into the shop below.\\n\\nWhen he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the\\nspot. At a small table, close up to the blank window and the white\\nstreet of snow, sat the old anarchist Professor over a glass of\\nmilk, with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids. For an\\ninstant Syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon. Then with a\\ngesture as of blind hurry, he brushed past the Professor, dashing\\nopen the door and slamming it behind him, and stood outside in the\\nsnow.\\n\\n\"Can that old corpse be following me?\" he asked himself, biting his\\nyellow moustache. \"I stopped too long up in that room, so that even\\nsuch leaden feet could catch me up. One comfort is, with a little\\nbrisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo.\\nOr am I too fanciful? Was he really following me? Surely Sunday\\nwould not be such a fool as to send a lame man? \"\\n\\nHe set off at a smart pace, twisting and whirling his stick, in\\nthe direction of Covent Garden. As he crossed the great market the\\nsnow increased, growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon\\nbegan to darken. The snow-flakes tormented him like a swarm of\\nsilver bees. Getting into his eyes and beard, they added their\\nunremitting futility to his already irritated nerves; and by the\\ntime that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet\\nStreet, he lost patience, and finding a Sunday teashop, turned\\ninto it to take shelter. He ordered another cup of black coffee\\nas an excuse. Scarcely had he done so, when Professor de Worms\\nhobbled heavily into the shop, sat down with difficulty and\\nordered a glass of milk.\\n\\nSyme\\'s walking-stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang,\\nwhich confessed the concealed steel. But the Professor did not look\\nround. Syme, who was commonly a cool character, was literally\\ngaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick. He had seen no cab\\nfollowing; he had heard no wheels outside the shop; to all mortal\\nappearances the man had come on foot. But the old man could only\\nwalk like a snail, and Syme had walked like the wind. He started up\\nand snatched his stick, half crazy with the contradiction in mere\\narithmetic, and swung out of the swinging doors, leaving his coffee\\nuntasted. An omnibus going to the Bank went rattling by with an\\nunusual rapidity. He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach\\nit; but he managed to spring, swaying upon the splash-board and,\\npausing for an instant to pant, he climbed on to the top. When he\\nhad been seated for about half a minute, he heard behind him a sort\\nof heavy and asthmatic breathing.\\n\\nTurning sharply, he saw rising gradually higher and higher up\\nthe omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow, and\\nunder the shadow of its brim the short-sighted face and shaky\\nshoulders of Professor de Worms. He let himself into a seat with\\ncharacteristic care, and wrapped himself up to the chin in the\\nmackintosh rug.\\n\\nEvery movement of the old man\\'s tottering figure and vague hands,\\nevery uncertain gesture and panic-stricken pause, seemed to put\\nit beyond question that he was helpless, that he was in the last\\nimbecility of the body. He moved by inches, he let himself down\\nwith little gasps of caution. And yet, unless the philosophical\\nentities called time and space have no vestige even of a practical\\nexistence, it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after\\nthe omnibus.\\n\\nSyme sprang erect upon the rocking car, and after staring wildly\\nat the wintry sky, that grew gloomier every moment, he ran down\\nthe steps. He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the\\nside.\\n\\nToo bewildered to look back or to reason, he rushed into one of\\nthe little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes\\ninto a hole. He had a vague idea, if this incomprehensible old\\nJack-in-the-box was really pursuing him, that in that labyrinth of\\nlittle streets he could soon throw him off the scent. He dived in\\nand out of those crooked lanes, which were more like cracks than\\nthoroughfares; and by the time that he had completed about twenty\\nalternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon, he paused\\nto listen for any sound of pursuit. There was none; there could\\nnot in any case have been much, for the little streets were thick\\nwith the soundless snow. Somewhere behind Red Lion Court, however,\\nhe noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away\\nthe snow for a space of about twenty yards, leaving the wet,\\nglistening cobble-stones. He thought little of this as he passed\\nit, only plunging into yet another arm of the maze. But when a few\\nhundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen, his heart\\nstood still also, for he heard from that space of rugged stones\\nthe clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple.\\n\\nThe sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow, leaving London\\nin a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the\\nevening. On each side of Syme the walls of the alley were blind\\nand featureless; there was no little window or any kind of eve. He\\nfelt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses, and to get\\nonce more into the open and lamp-lit street. Yet he rambled and\\ndodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare.\\nWhen he did so, he struck it much farther up than he had fancied.\\nHe came out into what seemed the vast and void of Ludgate Circus,\\nand saw St. Paul\\'s Cathedral sitting in the sky.\\n\\nAt first he was startled to find these great roads so empty, as if\\na pestilence had swept through the city. Then he told himself that\\nsome degree of emptiness was natural; first because the snow-storm\\nwas even dangerously deep, and secondly because it was Sunday. And\\nat the very word Sunday he bit his lip; the word was henceforth for\\nhire like some indecent pun. Under the white fog of snow high up in\\nthe heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very\\nqueer kind of green twilight, as of men under the sea. The sealed\\nand sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St. Paul\\'s had in it\\nsmoky and sinister colours--colours of sickly green, dead red or\\ndecaying bronze, that were just bright enough to emphasise the\\nsolid whiteness of the snow. But right up against these dreary\\ncolours rose the black bulk of the cathedral; and upon the top of\\nthe cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow, still\\nclinging as to an Alpine peak. It had fallen accidentally, but just\\nso fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point,\\nand to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross. When\\nSyme saw it he suddenly straightened himself, and made with his\\nsword-stick an involuntary salute.\\n\\nHe knew that that evil figure, his shadow, was creeping quickly or\\nslowly behind him, and he did not care.\\n\\nIt seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies\\nwere darkening that high place of the earth was bright. The\\ndevils might have captured heaven, but they had not yet captured\\nthe cross. He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this\\ndancing, jumping and pursuing paralytic; and at the entrance of\\nthe court as it opened upon the Circus he turned, stick in hand,\\nto face his pursuer.\\n\\nProfessor de Worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular\\nalley behind him, his unnatural form outlined against a lonely\\ngas-lamp, irresistibly recalling that very imaginative figure in\\nthe nursery rhymes, \"the crooked man who went a crooked mile.\" He\\nreally looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the\\ntortuous streets he had been threading. He came nearer and nearer,\\nthe lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles, his lifted,\\npatient face. Syme waited for him as St. George waited for the\\ndragon, as a man waits for a final explanation or for death. And\\nthe old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total\\nstranger, without even a blink of his mournful eyelids.\\n\\nThere was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that\\nleft Syme in a final fury. The man\\'s colourless face and manner\\nseemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident.\\nSyme was galvanised with an energy that was something between\\nbitterness and a burst of boyish derision. He made a wild gesture\\nas if to knock the old man\\'s hat off, called out something like\\n\"Catch me if you can,\" and went racing away across the white, open\\nCircus. Concealment was impossible now; and looking back over his\\nshoulder, he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming\\nafter him with long, swinging strides like a man winning a mile\\nrace. But the head upon that bounding body was still pale, grave\\nand professional, like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a\\nharlequin.\\n\\nThis outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus, up Ludgate Hill,\\nround St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, along Cheapside, Syme remembering all\\nthe nightmares he had ever known. Then Syme broke away towards the\\nriver, and ended almost down by the docks. He saw the yellow panes\\nof a low, lighted public-house, flung himself into it and ordered\\nbeer. It was a foul tavern, sprinkled with foreign sailors, a\\nplace where opium might be smoked or knives drawn.\\n\\nA moment later Professor de Worms entered the place, sat down\\ncarefully, and asked for a glass of milk.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTHE PROFESSOR EXPLAINS\\n\\nWHEN Gabriel Syme found himself finally established in a chair,\\nand opposite to him, fixed and final also, the lifted eyebrows and\\nleaden eyelids of the Professor, his fears fully returned. This\\nincomprehensible man from the fierce council, after all, had\\ncertainly pursued him. If the man had one character as a paralytic\\nand another character as a pursuer, the antithesis might make him\\nmore interesting, but scarcely more soothing. It would be a very\\nsmall comfort that he could not find the Professor out, if by some\\nserious accident the Professor should find him out. He emptied a\\nwhole pewter pot of ale before the professor had touched his milk.\\n\\nOne possibility, however, kept him hopeful and yet helpless. It was\\njust possible that this escapade signified something other than\\neven a slight suspicion of him. Perhaps it was some regular form or\\nsign. Perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal\\nthat he ought to have understood. Perhaps it was a ritual. Perhaps\\nthe new Thursday was always chased along Cheapside, as the new Lord\\nMayor is always escorted along it. He was just selecting a\\ntentative inquiry, when the old Professor opposite suddenly and\\nsimply cut him short. Before Syme could ask the first diplomatic\\nquestion, the old anarchist had asked suddenly, without any sort of\\npreparation--\\n\\n\"Are you a policeman?\"\\n\\nWhatever else Syme had expected, he had never expected anything so\\nbrutal and actual as this. Even his great presence of mind could\\nonly manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity.\\n\\n\"A policeman?\" he said, laughing vaguely. \"Whatever made you think\\nof a policeman in connection with me?\"\\n\\n\"The process was simple enough,\" answered the Professor patiently.\\n\"I thought you looked like a policeman. I think so now.\"\\n\\n\"Did I take a policeman\\'s hat by mistake out of the restaurant?\"\\nasked Syme, smiling wildly. \"Have I by any chance got a number\\nstuck on to me somewhere? Have my boots got that watchful look?\\nWhy must I be a policeman? Do, do let me be a postman.\"\\n\\nThe old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope,\\nbut Syme ran on with a feverish irony.\\n\\n\"But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German\\nphilosophy. Perhaps policeman is a relative term. In an\\nevolutionary sense, sir, the ape fades so gradually into the\\npoliceman, that I myself can never detect the shade. The monkey is\\nonly the policeman that may be. Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham\\nCommon is only the policeman that might have been. I don\\'t mind\\nbeing the policeman that might have been. I don\\'t mind being\\nanything in German thought.\"\\n\\n\"Are you in the police service?\" said the old man, ignoring all\\nSyme\\'s improvised and desperate raillery. \"Are you a detective?\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s heart turned to stone, but his face never changed.\\n\\n\"Your suggestion is ridiculous,\" he began. \"Why on earth--\"\\n\\nThe old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety\\ntable, nearly breaking it.\\n\\n\"Did you hear me ask a plain question, you pattering spy?\" he\\nshrieked in a high, crazy voice. \"Are you, or are you not, a\\npolice detective?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" answered Syme, like a man standing on the hangman\\'s drop.\\n\\n\"You swear it,\" said the old man, leaning across to him, his dead\\nface becoming as it were loathsomely alive. \"You swear it! You\\nswear it! If you swear falsely, will you be damned? Will you be\\nsure that the devil dances at your funeral? Will you see that the\\nnightmare sits on your grave? Will there really be no mistake? You\\nare an anarchist, you are a dynamiter! Above all, you are not in\\nany sense a detective? You are not in the British police?\"\\n\\nHe leant his angular elbow far across the table, and put up his\\nlarge loose hand like a flap to his ear.\\n\\n\"I am not in the British police,\" said Syme with insane calm.\\n\\nProfessor de Worms fell back in his chair with a curious air of\\nkindly collapse.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a pity,\" he said, \"because I am.\"\\n\\nSyme sprang up straight, sending back the bench behind him with a\\ncrash.\\n\\n\"Because you are what?\" he said thickly. \"You are what?\"\\n\\n\"I am a policeman,\" said the Professor with his first broad smile.\\nand beaming through his spectacles. \"But as you think policeman\\nonly a relative term, of course I have nothing to do with you. I\\nam in the British police force; but as you tell me you are not in\\nthe British police force, I can only say that I met you in a\\ndynamiters\\' club. I suppose I ought to arrest you.\" And with these\\nwords he laid on the table before Syme an exact facsimile of the\\nblue card which Syme had in his own waistcoat pocket, the symbol\\nof his power from the police.\\n\\nSyme had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned\\nexactly upside down, that all trees were growing downwards and\\nthat all stars were under his feet. Then came slowly the opposite\\nconviction. For the last twenty-four hours the cosmos had really\\nbeen upside down, but now the capsized universe had come right side\\nup again. This devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only\\nan elder brother of his own house, who on the other side of the\\ntable lay back and laughed at him. He did not for the moment ask\\nany questions of detail; he only knew the happy and silly fact that\\nthis shadow, which had pursued him with an intolerable oppression\\nof peril, was only the shadow of a friend trying to catch him up.\\nHe knew simultaneously that he was a fool and a free man. For with\\nany recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy\\nhumiliation. There comes a certain point in such conditions when\\nonly three things are possible: first a perpetuation of Satanic\\npride, secondly tears, and third laughter. Syme\\'s egotism held hard\\nto the first course for a few seconds, and then suddenly adopted\\nthe third. Taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist\\ncoat pocket, he tossed it on to the table; then he flung his head\\nback until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling,\\nand shouted with a barbaric laughter.\\n\\nEven in that close den, perpetually filled with the din of knives,\\nplates, cans, clamorous voices, sudden struggles and stampedes,\\nthere was something Homeric in Syme\\'s mirth which made many\\nhalf-drunken men look round.\\n\\n\"What yer laughing at, guv\\'nor?\" asked one wondering labourer from\\nthe docks.\\n\\n\"At myself,\" answered Syme, and went off again into the agony of\\nhis ecstatic reaction.\\n\\n\"Pull yourself together,\" said the Professor, \"or you\\'ll get\\nhysterical. Have some more beer. I\\'ll join you.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t drunk your milk,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"My milk!\" said the other, in tones of withering and unfathomable\\ncontempt, \"my milk! Do you think I\\'d look at the beastly stuff when\\nI\\'m out of sight of the bloody anarchists? We\\'re all Christians in\\nthis room, though perhaps,\" he added, glancing around at the\\nreeling crowd, \"not strict ones. Finish my milk? Great blazes! yes,\\nI\\'ll finish it right enough!\" and he knocked the tumbler off the\\ntable, making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid.\\n\\nSyme was staring at him with a happy curiosity.\\n\\n\"I understand now,\" he cried; \"of course, you\\'re not an old man at\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t take my face off here,\" replied Professor de Worms. \"It\\'s\\nrather an elaborate make-up. As to whether I\\'m an old man, that\\'s\\nnot for me to say. I was thirty-eight last birthday.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I mean,\" said Syme impatiently, \"there\\'s nothing the\\nmatter with you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the other dispassionately. \"I am subject to colds.\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief.\\nHe laughed at the idea of the paralytic Professor being really a\\nyoung actor dressed up as if for the foot-lights. But he felt that\\nhe would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over.\\n\\nThe false Professor drank and wiped his false beard.\\n\\n\"Did you know,\" he asked, \"that that man Gogol was one of us?\"\\n\\n\"I? No, I didn\\'t know it,\" answered Syme in some surprise. \"But\\ndidn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"I knew no more than the dead,\" replied the man who called himself\\nde Worms. \"I thought the President was talking about me, and I\\nrattled in my boots.\"\\n\\n\"And I thought he was talking about me,\" said Syme, with his rather\\nreckless laughter. \"I had my hand on my revolver all the time.\"\\n\\n\"So had I,\" said the Professor grimly; \"so had Gogol evidently.\"\\n\\nSyme struck the table with an exclamation.\\n\\n\"Why, there were three of us there!\" he cried. \"Three out of seven\\nis a fighting number. If we had only known that we were three!\"\\n\\nThe face of Professor de Worms darkened, and he did not look up.\\n\\n\"We were three,\" he said. \"If we had been three hundred we could\\nstill have done nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Not if we were three hundred against four?\" asked Syme, jeering\\nrather boisterously.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Professor with sobriety, \"not if we were three\\nhundred against Sunday.\"\\n\\nAnd the mere name struck Syme cold and serious; his laughter had\\ndied in his heart before it could die on his lips. The face of\\nthe unforgettable President sprang into his mind as startling as\\na coloured photograph, and he remarked this difference between\\nSunday and all his satellites, that their faces, however fierce\\nor sinister, became gradually blurred by memory like other human\\nfaces, whereas Sunday\\'s seemed almost to grow more actual during\\nabsence, as if a man\\'s painted portrait should slowly come alive.\\n\\nThey were both silent for a measure of moments, and then Syme\\'s\\nspeech came with a rush, like the sudden foaming of champagne.\\n\\n\"Professor,\" he cried, \"it is intolerable. Are you afraid of this\\nman?\"\\n\\nThe Professor lifted his heavy lids, and gazed at Syme with large,\\nwide-open, blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty.\\n\\n\"Yes, I am,\" he said mildly. \"So are you.\"\\n\\nSyme was dumb for an instant. Then he rose to his feet erect, like\\nan insulted man, and thrust the chair away from him.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said in a voice indescribable, \"you are right. I am\\nafraid of him. Therefore I swear by God that I will seek out this\\nman whom I fear until I find him, and strike him on the mouth. If\\nheaven were his throne and the earth his footstool, I swear that\\nI would pull him down.\"\\n\\n\"How?\" asked the staring Professor. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because I am afraid of him,\" said Syme; \"and no man should leave\\nin the universe anything of which he is afraid.\"\\n\\nDe Worms blinked at him with a sort of blind wonder. He made an\\neffort to speak, but Syme went on in a low voice, but with an\\nundercurrent of inhuman exaltation--\\n\\n\"Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does\\nnot fear? Who would debase himself to be merely brave, like any\\ncommon prizefighter? Who would stoop to be fearless--like a tree?\\nFight the thing that you fear. You remember the old tale of the\\nEnglish clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of Sicily,\\nand how on his death-bed the great robber said, \\'I can give you no\\nmoney, but I can give you advice for a lifetime: your thumb on the\\nblade, and strike upwards.\\' So I say to you, strike upwards, if you\\nstrike at the stars.\"\\n\\nThe other looked at the ceiling, one of the tricks of his pose.\\n\\n\"Sunday is a fixed star,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You shall see him a falling star,\" said Syme, and put on his hat.\\n\\nThe decision of his gesture drew the Professor vaguely to his feet.\\n\\n\"Have you any idea,\" he asked, with a sort of benevolent\\nbewilderment, \"exactly where you are going?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Syme shortly, \"I am going to prevent this bomb being\\nthrown in Paris.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any conception how?\" inquired the other.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme with equal decision.\\n\\n\"You remember, of course,\" resumed the soi-disant de Worms, pulling\\nhis beard and looking out of the window, \"that when we broke up\\nrather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left\\nin the private hands of the Marquis and Dr. Bull. The Marquis is by\\nthis time probably crossing the Channel. But where he will go and\\nwhat he will do it is doubtful whether even the President knows;\\ncertainly we don\\'t know. The only man who does know is Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"Confound it!\" cried Syme. \"And we don\\'t know where he is.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the other in his curious, absent-minded way, \"I know\\nwhere he is myself.\"\\n\\n\"Will you tell me?\" asked Syme with eager eyes.\\n\\n\"I will take you there,\" said the Professor, and took down his own\\nhat from a peg.\\n\\nSyme stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked sharply. \"Will you join me? Will you\\ntake the risk?\"\\n\\n\"Young man,\" said the Professor pleasantly, \"I am amused to observe\\nthat you think I am a coward. As to that I will say only one word,\\nand that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical\\nrhetoric. You think that it is possible to pull down the President.\\nI know that it is impossible, and I am going to try it,\" and\\nopening the tavern door, which let in a blast of bitter air, they\\nwent out together into the dark streets by the docks.\\n\\nMost of the snow was melted or trampled to mud, but here and there\\na clot of it still showed grey rather than white in the gloom. The\\nsmall streets were sloppy and full of pools, which reflected the\\nflaming lamps irregularly, and by accident, like fragments of some\\nother and fallen world. Syme felt almost dazed as he stepped\\nthrough this growing confusion of lights and shadows; but his\\ncompanion walked on with a certain briskness, towards where, at\\nthe end of the street, an inch or two of the lamplit river looked\\nlike a bar of flame.\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" Syme inquired.\\n\\n\"Just now,\" answered the Professor, \"I am going just round the\\ncorner to see whether Dr. Bull has gone to bed. He is hygienic,\\nand retires early.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull!\" exclaimed Syme. \"Does he live round the corner?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered his friend. \"As a matter of fact he lives some way\\noff, on the other side of the river, but we can tell from here\\nwhether he has gone to bed.\"\\n\\nTurning the corner as he spoke, and facing the dim river, flecked\\nwith flame, he pointed with his stick to the other bank. On the\\nSurrey side at this point there ran out into the Thames, seeming\\nalmost to overhang it, a bulk and cluster of those tall tenements,\\ndotted with lighted windows, and rising like factory chimneys to\\nan almost insane height. Their special poise and position made one\\nblock of buildings especially look like a Tower of Babel with a\\nhundred eyes. Syme had never seen any of the sky-scraping buildings\\nin America, so he could only think of the buildings in a dream.\\n\\nEven as he stared, the highest light in this innumerably lighted\\nturret abruptly went out, as if this black Argus had winked at him\\nwith one of his innumerable eyes.\\n\\nProfessor de Worms swung round on his heel, and struck his stick\\nagainst his boot.\\n\\n\"We are too late,\" he said, \"the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Syme. \"Does he live over there, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said de Worms, \"behind that particular window which you\\ncan\\'t see. Come along and get some dinner. We must call on him\\ntomorrow morning.\"\\n\\nWithout further parley, he led the way through several by-ways\\nuntil they came out into the flare and clamour of the East India\\nDock Road. The Professor, who seemed to know his way about the\\nneighbourhood, proceeded to a place where the line of lighted\\nshops fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet, in which\\nan old white inn, all out of repair, stood back some twenty feet\\nfrom the road.\\n\\n\"You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere, like\\nfossils,\" explained the Professor. \"I once found a decent place in\\nthe West End.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" said Syme, smiling, \"that this is the corresponding\\ndecent place in the East End?\"\\n\\n\"It is,\" said the Professor reverently, and went in.\\n\\nIn that place they dined and slept, both very thoroughly. The\\nbeans and bacon, which these unaccountable people cooked well,\\nthe astonishing emergence of Burgundy from their cellars, crowned\\nSyme\\'s sense of a new comradeship and comfort. Through all this\\nordeal his root horror had been isolation, and there are no words\\nto express the abyss between isolation and having one ally. It may\\nbe conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two. But two\\nis not twice one; two is two thousand times one. That is why, in\\nspite of a hundred disadvantages, the world will always return to\\nmonogamy.\\n\\nSyme was able to pour out for the first time the whole of his\\noutrageous tale, from the time when Gregory had taken him to\\nthe little tavern by the river. He did it idly and amply, in a\\nluxuriant monologue, as a man speaks with very old friends. On\\nhis side, also, the man who had impersonated Professor de Worms\\nwas not less communicative. His own story was almost as silly as\\nSyme\\'s.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a good get-up of yours,\" said Syme, draining a glass of\\nMacon; \"a lot better than old Gogol\\'s. Even at the start I thought\\nhe was a bit too hairy.\"\\n\\n\"A difference of artistic theory,\" replied the Professor pensively.\\n\"Gogol was an idealist. He made up as the abstract or platonic\\nideal of an anarchist. But I am a realist. I am a portrait painter.\\nBut, indeed, to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate\\nexpression. I am a portrait.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand you,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"I am a portrait,\" repeated the Professor. \"I am a portrait of the\\ncelebrated Professor de Worms, who is, I believe, in Naples.\"\\n\\n\"You mean you are made up like him,\" said Syme. \"But doesn\\'t he\\nknow that you are taking his nose in vain?\"\\n\\n\"He knows it right enough,\" replied his friend cheerfully.\\n\\n\"Then why doesn\\'t he denounce you?\"\\n\\n\"I have denounced him,\" answered the Professor.\\n\\n\"Do explain yourself,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"With pleasure, if you don\\'t mind hearing my story,\" replied the\\neminent foreign philosopher. \"I am by profession an actor, and my\\nname is Wilks. When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of\\nBohemian and blackguard company. Sometimes I touched the edge of\\nthe turf, sometimes the riff-raff of the arts, and occasionally the\\npolitical refugee. In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced\\nto the great German Nihilist philosopher, Professor de Worms. I did\\nnot gather much about him beyond his appearance, which was very\\ndisgusting, and which I studied carefully. I understood that he had\\nproved that the destructive principle in the universe was God;\\nhence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy,\\nrending all things in pieces. Energy, he said, was the All. He was\\nlame, shortsighted, and partially paralytic. When I met him I was\\nin a frivolous mood, and I disliked him so much that I resolved to\\nimitate him. If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a\\ncaricature. I was only an actor, I could only act a caricature. I\\nmade myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the\\nold Professor\\'s dirty old self. When I went into the room full of\\nhis supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter,\\nor (if they were too far gone) with a roar of indignation at the\\ninsult. I cannot describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was\\nreceived with a respectful silence, followed (when I had first\\nopened my lips) with a murmur of admiration. The curse of the\\nperfect artist had fallen upon me. I had been too subtle, I had\\nbeen too true. They thought I really was the great Nihilist\\nProfessor. I was a healthy-minded young man at the time, and I\\nconfess that it was a blow. Before I could fully recover, however,\\ntwo or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation,\\nand told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next\\nroom. I inquired its nature. It seemed that an impertinent fellow\\nhad dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself. I had\\ndrunk more champagne than was good for me, and in a flash of folly\\nI decided to see the situation through. Consequently it was to meet\\nthe glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing\\neyes that the real Professor came into the room.\\n\\n\"I need hardly say there was a collision. The pessimists all round\\nme looked anxiously from one Professor to the other Professor to\\nsee which was really the more feeble. But I won. An old man in poor\\nhealth, like my rival, could not be expected to be so impressively\\nfeeble as a young actor in the prime of life. You see, he really\\nhad paralysis, and working within this definite limitation, he\\ncouldn\\'t be so jolly paralytic as I was. Then he tried to blast my\\nclaims intellectually. I countered that by a very simple dodge.\\nWhenever he said something that nobody but he could understand, I\\nreplied with something which I could not even understand myself.\\n\\'I don\\'t fancy,\\' he said, \\'that you could have worked out the\\nprinciple that evolution is only negation, since there inheres in\\nit the introduction of lacuna, which are an essential of\\ndifferentiation.\\' I replied quite scornfully, \\'You read all that up\\nin Pinckwerts; the notion that involution functioned eugenically\\nwas exposed long ago by Glumpe.\\' It is unnecessary for me to say\\nthat there never were such people as Pinckwerts and Glumpe. But the\\npeople all round (rather to my surprise) seemed to remember them\\nquite well, and the Professor, finding that the learned and\\nmysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly\\ndeficient in scruples, fell back upon a more popular form of wit.\\n\\'I see,\\' he sneered, \\'you prevail like the false pig in Aesop.\\'\\n\\'And you fail,\\' I answered, smiling, \\'like the hedgehog in\\nMontaigne.\\' Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne?\\n\\'Your claptrap comes off,\\' he said; \\'so would your beard.\\' I had no\\nintelligent answer to this, which was quite true and rather witty.\\nBut I laughed heartily, answered, \\'Like the Pantheist\\'s boots,\\' at\\nrandom, and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory. The\\nreal Professor was thrown out, but not with violence, though one\\nman tried very patiently to pull off his nose. He is now, I\\nbelieve, received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor.\\nHis apparent earnestness and anger, you see, make him all the more\\nentertaining.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme, \"I can understand your putting on his dirty old\\nbeard for a night\\'s practical joke, but I don\\'t understand your\\nnever taking it off again.\"\\n\\n\"That is the rest of the story,\" said the impersonator. \"When I\\nmyself left the company, followed by reverent applause, I went\\nlimping down the dark street, hoping that I should soon be far\\nenough away to be able to walk like a human being. To my\\nastonishment, as I was turning the corner, I felt a touch on the\\nshoulder, and turning, found myself under the shadow of an enormous\\npoliceman. He told me I was wanted. I struck a sort of paralytic\\nattitude, and cried in a high German accent, \\'Yes, I am wanted--by\\nthe oppressed of the world. You are arresting me on the charge of\\nbeing the great anarchist, Professor de Worms.\\' The policeman\\nimpassively consulted a paper in his hand, \\'No, sir,\\' he said\\ncivilly, \\'at least, not exactly, sir. I am arresting you on the\\ncharge of not being the celebrated anarchist, Professor de Worms.\\'\\nThis charge, if it was criminal at all, was certainly the lighter\\nof the two, and I went along with the man, doubtful, but not\\ngreatly dismayed. I was shown into a number of rooms, and\\neventually into the presence of a police officer, who explained\\nthat a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of\\nanarchy, and that this, my successful masquerade, might be of\\nconsiderable value to the public safety. He offered me a good\\nsalary and this little blue card. Though our conversation was\\nshort, he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and\\nhumour; but I cannot tell you much about him personally, because--\"\\n\\nSyme laid down his knife and fork.\\n\\n\"I know,\" he said, \"because you talked to him in a dark room.\"\\n\\nProfessor de Worms nodded and drained his glass.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nTHE MAN IN SPECTACLES\\n\\n\"BURGUNDY is a jolly thing,\" said the Professor sadly, as he set\\nhis glass down.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t look as if it were,\" said Syme; \"you drink it as if it\\nwere medicine.\"\\n\\n\"You must excuse my manner,\" said the Professor dismally, \"my\\nposition is rather a curious one. Inside I am really bursting with\\nboyish merriment; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well, that\\nnow I can\\'t leave off. So that when I am among friends, and have no\\nneed at all to disguise myself, I still can\\'t help speaking slow\\nand wrinkling my forehead--just as if it were my forehead. I can be\\nquite happy, you understand, but only in a paralytic sort of way.\\nThe most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart, but they come\\nout of my mouth quite different. You should hear me say, \\'Buck up,\\nold cock!\\' It would bring tears to your eyes.\"\\n\\n\"It does,\" said Syme; \"but I cannot help thinking that apart from\\nall that you are really a bit worried.\"\\n\\nThe Professor started a little and looked at him steadily.\\n\\n\"You are a very clever fellow,\" he said, \"it is a pleasure to work\\nwith you. Yes, I have rather a heavy cloud in my head. There is a\\ngreat problem to face,\" and he sank his bald brow in his two hands.\\n\\nThen he said in a low voice--\\n\\n\"Can you play the piano?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme in simple wonder, \"I\\'m supposed to have a good\\ntouch.\"\\n\\nThen, as the other did not speak, he added--\\n\\n\"I trust the great cloud is lifted.\"\\n\\nAfter a long silence, the Professor said out of the cavernous\\nshadow of his hands--\\n\\n\"It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Syme, \"you flatter me.\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" said the other, \"and remember whom we have to see\\ntomorrow. You and I are going tomorrow to attempt something which\\nis very much more dangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels\\nout of the Tower. We are trying to steal a secret from a very\\nsharp, very strong, and very wicked man. I believe there is no man,\\nexcept the President, of course, who is so seriously startling and\\nformidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles. He has not\\nperhaps the white-hot enthusiasm unto death, the mad martyrdom for\\nanarchy, which marks the Secretary. But then that very fanaticism\\nin the Secretary has a human pathos, and is almost a redeeming\\ntrait. But the little Doctor has a brutal sanity that is more\\nshocking than the Secretary\\'s disease. Don\\'t you notice his\\ndetestable virility and vitality. He bounces like an india-rubber\\nball. Depend on it, Sunday was not asleep (I wonder if he ever\\nsleeps?) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the\\nround, black head of Dr. Bull.\"\\n\\n\"And you think,\" said Syme, \"that this unique monster will be\\nsoothed if I play the piano to him?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be an ass,\" said his mentor. \"I mentioned the piano because\\nit gives one quick and independent fingers. Syme, if we are to go\\nthrough this interview and come out sane or alive, we must have\\nsome code of signals between us that this brute will not see. I\\nhave made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five\\nfingers--like this, see,\" and he rippled with his fingers on the\\nwooden table--\"B A D, bad, a word we may frequently require.\"\\n\\nSyme poured himself out another glass of wine, and began to study\\nthe scheme. He was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles,\\nand with his hands at conjuring, and it did not take him long to\\nlearn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to\\nbe idle taps upon a table or knee. But wine and companionship had\\nalways the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity, and\\nthe Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast\\nenergy of the new language, as it passed through the heated brain\\nof Syme.\\n\\n\"We must have several word-signs,\" said Syme seriously--\"words that\\nwe are likely to want, fine shades of meaning. My favourite word is\\n\\'coeval\\'. What\\'s yours?\"\\n\\n\"Do stop playing the goat,\" said the Professor plaintively. \"You\\ndon\\'t know how serious this is.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Lush\\' too,\" said Syme, shaking his head sagaciously, \"we must\\nhave \\'lush\\'--word applied to grass, don\\'t you know?\"\\n\\n\"Do you imagine,\" asked the Professor furiously, \"that we are going\\nto talk to Dr. Bull about grass?\"\\n\\n\"There are several ways in which the subject could be approached,\"\\nsaid Syme reflectively, \"and the word introduced without appearing\\nforced. We might say, \\'Dr. Bull, as a revolutionist, you remember\\nthat a tyrant once advised us to eat grass; and indeed many of us,\\nlooking on the fresh lush grass of summer\"\\'\\n\\n\"Do you understand,\" said the other, \"that this is a tragedy?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly,\" replied Syme; \"always be comic in a tragedy. What\\nthe deuce else can you do? I wish this language of yours had a\\nwider scope. I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers\\nto the toes? That would involve pulling off our boots and socks\\nduring the conversation, which however unobtrusively performed--\"\\n\\n\"Syme,\" said his friend with a stern simplicity, \"go to bed!\"\\n\\nSyme, however, sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the\\nnew code. He was awakened next morning while the east was still\\nsealed with darkness, and found his grey-bearded ally standing like\\na ghost beside his bed.\\n\\nSyme sat up in bed blinking; then slowly collected his thoughts,\\nthrew off the bed-clothes, and stood up. It seemed to him in some\\ncurious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before\\nfell with the bedclothes off him, and he stood up in an air of cold\\ndanger. He still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his\\ncompanion; but it was the trust between two men going to the\\nscaffold.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his\\ntrousers, \"I dreamt of that alphabet of yours. Did it take you\\nlong to make it up?\"\\n\\nThe Professor made no answer, but gazed in front of him with eyes\\nthe colour of a wintry sea; so Syme repeated his question.\\n\\n\"I say, did it take you long to invent all this? I\\'m considered\\ngood at these things, and it was a good hour\\'s grind. Did you\\nlearn it all on the spot?\"\\n\\nThe Professor was silent; his eyes were wide open, and he wore a\\nfixed but very small smile.\\n\\n\"How long did it take you?\"\\n\\nThe Professor did not move.\\n\\n\"Confound you, can\\'t you answer?\" called out Syme, in a sudden\\nanger that had something like fear underneath. Whether or no the\\nProfessor could answer, he did not.\\n\\nSyme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the\\nblank, blue eyes. His first thought was that the Professor had gone\\nmad, but his second thought was more frightful. After all, what did\\nhe know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted\\nas a friend? What did he know, except that the man had been at the\\nanarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale? How\\nimprobable it was that there should be another friend there beside\\nGogol! Was this man\\'s silence a sensational way of declaring war?\\nWas this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some\\nthreefold traitor, who had turned for the last time? He stood and\\nstrained his ears in this heartless silence. He almost fancied he\\ncould hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the\\ncorridor outside.\\n\\nThen his eye strayed downwards, and he burst out laughing. Though\\nthe Professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue, his\\nfive dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table. Syme\\nwatched the twinkling movements of the talking hand, and read\\nclearly the message--\\n\\n\"I will only talk like this. We must get used to it.\"\\n\\nHe rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief--\\n\\n\"All right. Let\\'s get out to breakfast.\"\\n\\nThey took their hats and sticks in silence; but as Syme took his\\nsword-stick, he held it hard.\\n\\nThey paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse\\nthick sandwiches at a coffee stall, and then made their way across\\nthe river, which under the grey and growing light looked as\\ndesolate as Acheron. They reached the bottom of the huge block of\\nbuildings which they had seen from across the river, and began in\\nsilence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps, only pausing\\nnow and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters. At\\nabout every other flight they passed a window; each window showed\\nthem a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over London.\\nFrom each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden\\nsurges of a grey, troubled sea after rain. Syme was increasingly\\nconscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold\\nsanity worse than the wild adventures of the past. Last night, for\\ninstance, the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a\\ndream. As he now went up the weary and perpetual steps, he was\\ndaunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series. But it was\\nnot the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be\\nexaggeration or delusion. Their infinity was more like the empty\\ninfinity of arithmetic, something unthinkable, yet necessary to\\nthought. Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about\\nthe distance of the fixed stars. He was ascending the house of\\nreason, a thing more hideous than unreason itself.\\n\\nBy the time they reached Dr. Bull\\'s landing, a last window showed\\nthem a harsh, white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red,\\nmore like red clay than red cloud. And when they entered Dr. Bull\\'s\\nbare garret it was full of light.\\n\\nSyme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with\\nthese empty rooms and that austere daybreak. The moment he saw the\\ngarret and Dr. Bull sitting writing at a table, he remembered what\\nthe memory was--the French Revolution. There should have been the\\nblack outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of\\nthe morning. Dr. Bull was in his white shirt and black breeches\\nonly; his cropped, dark head might well have just come out of its\\nwig; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre.\\n\\nYet when he was seen properly, the French fancy fell away. The\\nJacobins were idealists; there was about this man a murderous\\nmaterialism. His Dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance. The\\nstrong, white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp\\nshadows, made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had\\nlooked at the breakfast on the balcony. Thus the two black glasses\\nthat encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his\\nskull, making him look like a death\\'s-head. And, indeed, if ever\\nDeath himself sat writing at a wooden table, it might have been he.\\n\\nHe looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in, and\\nrose with the resilient rapidity of which the Professor had\\nspoken. He set chairs for both of them, and going to a peg behind\\nthe door, proceeded to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough, dark\\ntweed; he buttoned it up neatly, and came back to sit down at his\\ntable.\\n\\nThe quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents\\nhelpless. It was with some momentary difficulty that the\\nProfessor broke silence and began, \"I\\'m sorry to disturb you so\\nearly, comrade,\" said he, with a careful resumption of the slow\\nde Worms manner. \"You have no doubt made all the arrangements for\\nthe Paris affair?\" Then he added with infinite slowness, \"We have\\ninformation which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a\\nmoment\\'s delay.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull smiled again, but continued to gaze on them without\\nspeaking. The Professor resumed, a pause before each weary word--\\n\\n\"Please do not think me excessively abrupt; but I advise you to\\nalter those plans, or if it is too late for that, to follow your\\nagent with all the support you can get for him. Comrade Syme and\\nI have had an experience which it would take more time to recount\\nthan we can afford, if we are to act on it. I will, however,\\nrelate the occurrence in detail, even at the risk of losing time,\\nif you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of\\nthe problem we have to discuss.\"\\n\\nHe was spinning out his sentences, making them intolerably long\\nand lingering, in the hope of maddening the practical little\\nDoctor into an explosion of impatience which might show his hand.\\nBut the little Doctor continued only to stare and smile, and the\\nmonologue was uphill work. Syme began to feel a new sickness and\\ndespair. The Doctor\\'s smile and silence were not at all like the\\ncataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in\\nthe Professor half an hour before. About the Professor\\'s makeup\\nand all his antics there was always something merely grotesque,\\nlike a gollywog. Syme remembered those wild woes of yesterday as\\none remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood. But here was\\ndaylight; here was a healthy, square-shouldered man in tweeds,\\nnot odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles, not glaring\\nor grinning at all, but smiling steadily and not saying a word.\\nThe whole had a sense of unbearable reality. Under the increasing\\nsunlight the colours of the Doctor\\'s complexion, the pattern of\\nhis tweeds, grew and expanded outrageously, as such things grow\\ntoo important in a realistic novel. But his smile was quite\\nslight, the pose of his head polite; the only uncanny thing was\\nhis silence.\\n\\n\"As I say,\" resumed the Professor, like a man toiling through\\nheavy sand, \"the incident that has occurred to us and has led\\nus to ask for information about the Marquis, is one which you\\nmay think it better to have narrated; but as it came in the\\nway of Comrade Syme rather than me--\"\\n\\nHis words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem;\\nbut Syme, who was watching, saw his long fingers rattle quickly\\non the edge of the crazy table. He read the message, \"You must\\ngo on. This devil has sucked me dry!\"\\n\\nSyme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation\\nwhich always came to him when he was alarmed.\\n\\n\"Yes, the thing really happened to me,\" he said hastily. \"I had\\nthe good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who\\ntook me, thanks to my hat, for a respectable person. Wishing to\\nclinch my reputation for respectability, I took him and made him\\nvery drunk at the Savoy. Under this influence he became friendly,\\nand told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope\\nto arrest the Marquis in France.\\n\\nSo unless you or I can get on his track--\"\\n\\nThe Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way, and his\\nprotected eyes were still impenetrable. The Professor signalled to\\nSyme that he would resume his explanation, and he began again with\\nthe same elaborate calm.\\n\\n\"Syme immediately brought this information to me, and we came here\\ntogether to see what use you would be inclined to make of it. It\\nseems to me unquestionably urgent that--\"\\n\\nAll this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as\\nsteadily as the Doctor stared at the Professor, but quite without\\nthe smile. The nerves of both comrades-in-arms were near snapping\\nunder that strain of motionless amiability, when Syme suddenly\\nleant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table. His message\\nto his ally ran, \"I have an intuition.\"\\n\\nThe Professor, with scarcely a pause in his monologue, signalled\\nback, \"Then sit on it.\"\\n\\nSyme telegraphed, \"It is quite extraordinary.\"\\n\\nThe other answered, \"Extraordinary rot!\"\\n\\nSyme said, \"I am a poet.\"\\n\\nThe other retorted, \"You are a dead man.\"\\n\\nSyme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair, and his eyes were\\nburning feverishly. As he said he had an intuition, and it had\\nrisen to a sort of lightheaded certainty. Resuming his symbolic\\ntaps, he signalled to his friend, \"You scarcely realise how poetic\\nmy intuition is. It has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in\\nthe coming of spring.\"\\n\\nHe then studied the answer on his friend\\'s fingers. The answer\\nwas, \"Go to hell! \"\\n\\nThe Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed\\nto the Doctor.\\n\\n\"Perhaps I should rather say,\" said Syme on his fingers, \"that it\\nresembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the\\nheart of lush woods.\"\\n\\nHis companion disdained to reply.\\n\\n\"Or yet again,\" tapped Syme, \"it is positive, as is the passionate\\nred hair of a beautiful woman.\"\\n\\nThe Professor was continuing his speech, but in the middle of it\\nSyme decided to act. He leant across the table, and said in a\\nvoice that could not be neglected--\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull!\"\\n\\nThe Doctor\\'s sleek and smiling head did not move, but they could\\nhave sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards\\nSyme.\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull,\" said Syme, in a voice peculiarly precise and\\ncourteous, \"would you do me a small favour? Would you be so kind\\nas to take off your spectacles?\"\\n\\nThe Professor swung round on his seat, and stared at Syme with a\\nsort of frozen fury of astonishment. Syme, like a man who has\\nthrown his life and fortune on the table, leaned forward with a\\nfiery face. The Doctor did not move.\\n\\nFor a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a\\npin drop, split once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on\\nthe Thames. Then Dr. Bull rose slowly, still smiling, and took\\noff his spectacles.\\n\\nSyme sprang to his feet, stepping backwards a little, like a\\nchemical lecturer from a successful explosion. His eyes were like\\nstars, and for an instant he could only point without speaking.\\n\\nThe Professor had also started to his feet, forgetful of his\\nsupposed paralysis. He leant on the back of the chair and stared\\ndoubtfully at Dr. Bull, as if the Doctor had been turned into a\\ntoad before his eyes. And indeed it was almost as great a\\ntransformation scene.\\n\\nThe two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very\\nboyish-looking young man, with very frank and happy hazel eyes, an\\nopen expression, cockney clothes like those of a city clerk, and\\nan unquestionable breath about him of being very good and rather\\ncommonplace. The smile was still there, but it might have been the\\nfirst smile of a baby.\\n\\n\"I knew I was a poet,\" cried Syme in a sort of ecstasy. \"I knew my\\nintuition was as infallible as the Pope. It was the spectacles that\\ndid it! It was all the spectacles. Given those beastly black eyes,\\nand all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks, made him a\\nlive devil among dead ones.\"\\n\\n\"It certainly does make a queer difference,\" said the Professor\\nshakily. \"But as regards the project of Dr. Bull--\"\\n\\n\"Project be damned!\" roared Syme, beside himself. \"Look at him!\\nLook at his face, look at his collar, look at his blessed boots!\\nYou don\\'t suppose, do you, that that thing\\'s an anarchist?\"\\n\\n\"Syme!\" cried the other in an apprehensive agony.\\n\\n\"Why, by God,\" said Syme, \"I\\'ll take the risk of that myself! Dr.\\nBull, I am a police officer. There\\'s my card,\" and he flung down\\nthe blue card upon the table.\\n\\nThe Professor still feared that all was lost; but he was loyal. He\\npulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend\\'s.\\nThen the third man burst out laughing, and for the first time that\\nmorning they heard his voice.\\n\\n\"I\\'m awfully glad you chaps have come so early,\" he said, with\\na sort of schoolboy flippancy, \"for we can all start for France\\ntogether. Yes, I\\'m in the force right enough,\" and he flicked a\\nblue card towards them lightly as a matter of form.\\n\\nClapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin\\nglasses, the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door, that the\\nothers instinctively followed him. Syme seemed a little distrait,\\nand as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick\\non the stone passage so that it rang.\\n\\n\"But Lord God Almighty,\" he cried out, \"if this is all right, there\\nwere more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at\\nthe damned Council!\"\\n\\n\"We might have fought easily,\" said Bull; \"we were four against\\nthree.\"\\n\\nThe Professor was descending the stairs, but his voice came up from\\nbelow.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the voice, \"we were not four against three--we were not\\nso lucky. We were four against One.\"\\n\\nThe others went down the stairs in silence.\\n\\nThe young man called Bull, with an innocent courtesy characteristic\\nof him, insisted on going last until they reached the street; but\\nthere his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously, and he\\nwalked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office, talking\\nto the others over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"It is jolly to get some pals,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been half dead with\\nthe jumps, being quite alone. I nearly flung my arms round Gogol\\nand embraced him, which would have been imprudent. I hope you won\\'t\\ndespise me for having been in a blue funk.\"\\n\\n\"All the blue devils in blue hell,\" said Syme, \"contributed to my\\nblue funk! But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles.\"\\n\\nThe young man laughed delightedly.\\n\\n\"Wasn\\'t it a rag?\" he said. \"Such a simple idea--not my own. I\\nhaven\\'t got the brains. You see, I wanted to go into the detective\\nservice, especially the anti-dynamite business. But for that\\npurpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter; and they\\nall swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter. They\\nsaid my very walk was respectable, and that seen from behind I\\nlooked like the British Constitution. They said I looked too\\nhealthy and too optimistic, and too reliable and benevolent; they\\ncalled me all sorts of names at Scotland Yard. They said that if I\\nhad been a criminal, I might have made my fortune by looking so\\nlike an honest man; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest\\nman, there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by\\never looking like a criminal. But as last I was brought before some\\nold josser who was high up in the force, and who seemed to have no\\nend of a head on his shoulders. And there the others all talked\\nhopelessly. One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice\\nsmile; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like\\na negro anarchist; but this old chap chipped in with a most\\nextraordinary remark. \\'A pair of smoked spectacles will do it,\\' he\\nsaid positively. \\'Look at him now; he looks like an angelic office\\nboy. Put him on a pair of smoked spectacles, and children will\\nscream at the sight of him.\\' And so it was, by George! When once my\\neyes were covered, all the rest, smile and big shoulders and short\\nhair, made me look a perfect little devil. As I say, it was simple\\nenough when it was done, like miracles; but that wasn\\'t the really\\nmiraculous part of it. There was one really staggering thing about\\nthe business, and my head still turns at it.\"\\n\\n\"What was that?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,\" answered the man in spectacles. \"This big pot in\\nthe police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would\\ngo with my hair and socks--by God, he never saw me at all!\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s eyes suddenly flashed on him.\\n\\n\"How was that?\" he asked. \"I thought you talked to him.\"\\n\\n\"So I did,\" said Bull brightly; \"but we talked in a pitch-dark\\nroom like a coalcellar. There, you would never have guessed that.\"\\n\\n\"I could not have conceived it,\" said Syme gravely.\\n\\n\"It is indeed a new idea,\" said the Professor.\\n\\nTheir new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind. At the\\ninquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains\\nfor Dover. Having got his information, he bundled the company into\\na cab, and put them and himself inside a railway carriage before\\nthey had properly realised the breathless process. They were\\nalready on the Calais boat before conversation flowed freely.\\n\\n\"I had already arranged,\" he explained, \"to go to France for my\\nlunch; but I am delighted to have someone to lunch with me. You\\nsee, I had to send that beast, the Marquis, over with his bomb,\\nbecause the President had his eye on me, though God knows how.\\nI\\'ll tell you the story some day. It was perfectly choking.\\nWhenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere,\\nsmiling out of the bow-window of a club, or taking off his hat to\\nme from the top of an omnibus. I tell you, you can say what you\\nlike, that fellow sold himself to the devil; he can be in six\\nplaces at once.\"\\n\\n\"So you sent the Marquis off, I understand,\" asked the Professor.\\n\"Was it long ago? Shall we be in time to catch him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the new guide, \"I\\'ve timed it all. He\\'ll still be\\nat Calais when we arrive.\"\\n\\n\"But when we do catch him at Calais,\" said the Professor, \"what are\\nwe going to do?\"\\n\\nAt this question the countenance of Dr. Bull fell for the first\\ntime. He reflected a little, and then said--\\n\\n\"Theoretically, I suppose, we ought to call the police.\"\\n\\n\"Not I,\" said Syme. \"Theoretically I ought to drown myself first. I\\npromised a poor fellow, who was a real modern pessimist, on my word\\nof honour not to tell the police. I\\'m no hand at casuistry, but I\\ncan\\'t break my word to a modern pessimist. It\\'s like breaking one\\'s\\nword to a child.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m in the same boat,\" said the Professor. \"I tried to tell the\\npolice and I couldn\\'t, because of some silly oath I took. You see,\\nwhen I was an actor I was a sort of all-round beast. Perjury or\\ntreason is the only crime I haven\\'t committed. If I did that I\\nshouldn\\'t know the difference between right and wrong.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been through all that,\" said Dr. Bull, \"and I\\'ve made up my\\nmind. I gave my promise to the Secretary--you know him, man who\\nsmiles upside down. My friends, that man is the most utterly\\nunhappy man that was ever human. It may be his digestion, or his\\nconscience, or his nerves, or his philosophy of the universe, but\\nhe\\'s damned, he\\'s in hell! Well, I can\\'t turn on a man like that,\\nand hunt him down. It\\'s like whipping a leper. I may be mad, but\\nthat\\'s how I feel; and there\\'s jolly well the end of it.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think you\\'re mad,\" said Syme. \"I knew you would decide\\nlike that when first you--\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"When first you took off your spectacles.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull smiled a little, and strolled across the deck to look at\\nthe sunlit sea. Then he strolled back again, kicking his heels\\ncarelessly, and a companionable silence fell between the three men.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme, \"it seems that we have all the same kind of\\nmorality or immorality, so we had better face the fact that comes\\nof it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" assented the Professor, \"you\\'re quite right; and we must\\nhurry up, for I can see the Grey Nose standing out from France.\"\\n\\n\"The fact that comes of it,\" said Syme seriously, \"is this, that we\\nthree are alone on this planet. Gogol has gone, God knows where;\\nperhaps the President has smashed him like a fly. On the Council we\\nare three men against three, like the Romans who held the bridge.\\nBut we are worse off than that, first because they can appeal to\\ntheir organization and we cannot appeal to ours, and second\\nbecause--\"\\n\\n\"Because one of those other three men,\" said the Professor, \"is not\\na man.\"\\n\\nSyme nodded and was silent for a second or two, then he said--\\n\\n\"My idea is this. We must do something to keep the Marquis in\\nCalais till tomorrow midday. I have turned over twenty schemes in\\nmy head. We cannot denounce him as a dynamiter; that is agreed. We\\ncannot get him detained on some trivial charge, for we should have\\nto appear; he knows us, and he would smell a rat. We cannot pretend\\nto keep him on anarchist business; he might swallow much in that\\nway, but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the Czar went\\nsafely through Paris. We might try to kidnap him, and lock him up\\nourselves; but he is a well-known man here. He has a whole\\nbodyguard of friends; he is very strong and brave, and the event is\\ndoubtful. The only thing I can see to do is actually to take\\nadvantage of the very things that are in the Marquis\\'s favour. I am\\ngoing to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman.\\nI am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves\\nin the best society.\"\\n\\n\"What the devil are you talking about?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century,\" said\\nSyme; \"but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce\\nat Bannockburn. Since 1350 the tree is quite clear.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s gone off his head,\" said the little Doctor, staring.\\n\\n\"Our bearings,\" continued Syme calmly, \"are \\'argent a chevron gules\\ncharged with three cross crosslets of the field.\\' The motto\\nvaries.\"\\n\\nThe Professor seized Syme roughly by the waistcoat.\\n\\n\"We are just inshore,\" he said. \"Are you seasick or joking in the\\nwrong place?\"\\n\\n\"My remarks are almost painfully practical,\" answered Syme, in an\\nunhurried manner. \"The house of St. Eustache also is very ancient.\\nThe Marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman. He cannot deny\\nthat I am a gentleman. And in order to put the matter of my social\\nposition quite beyond a doubt, I propose at the earliest\\nopportunity to knock his hat off. But here we are in the harbour.\"\\n\\nThey went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze. Syme,\\nwho had now taken the lead as Bull had taken it in London, led\\nthem along a kind of marine parade until he came to some cafes,\\nembowered in a bulk of greenery and overlooking the sea. As he\\nwent before them his step was slightly swaggering, and he swung\\nhis stick like a sword. He was making apparently for the extreme\\nend of the line of cafes, but he stopped abruptly. With a sharp\\ngesture he motioned them to silence, but he pointed with one\\ngloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage\\nat which sat the Marquis de St. Eustache, his teeth shining in\\nhis thick, black beard, and his bold, brown face shadowed by a\\nlight yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nTHE DUEL\\n\\nSYME sat down at a cafe table with his companions, his blue eyes\\nsparkling like the bright sea below, and ordered a bottle of\\nSaumur with a pleased impatience. He was for some reason in a\\ncondition of curious hilarity. His spirits were already\\nunnaturally high; they rose as the Saumur sank, and in half an\\nhour his talk was a torrent of nonsense. He professed to be\\nmaking out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue\\nbetween himself and the deadly Marquis. He jotted it down wildly\\nwith a pencil. It was arranged like a printed catechism, with\\nquestions and answers, and was delivered with an extraordinary\\nrapidity of utterance.\\n\\n\"I shall approach. Before taking off his hat, I shall take off my\\nown. I shall say, \\'The Marquis de Saint Eustache, I believe.\\' He\\nwill say, \\'The celebrated Mr. Syme, I presume.\\' He will say in the\\nmost exquisite French, \\'How are you?\\' I shall reply in the most\\nexquisite Cockney, \\'Oh, just the Syme--\\' \"\\n\\n\"Oh, shut it,\" said the man in spectacles. \"Pull yourself\\ntogether, and chuck away that bit of paper. What are you really\\ngoing to do?\"\\n\\n\"But it was a lovely catechism,\" said Syme pathetically. \"Do let\\nme read it you. It has only forty-three questions and answers, and\\nsome of the Marquis\\'s answers are wonderfully witty. I like to be\\njust to my enemy.\"\\n\\n\"But what\\'s the good of it all?\" asked Dr. Bull in exasperation.\\n\\n\"It leads up to my challenge, don\\'t you see,\" said Syme, beaming.\\n\"When the Marquis has given the thirty-ninth reply, which runs--\"\\n\\n\"Has it by any chance occurred to you,\" asked the Professor, with\\na ponderous simplicity, \"that the Marquis may not say all the\\nforty-three things you have put down for him? In that case, I\\nunderstand, your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced.\"\\n\\nSyme struck the table with a radiant face.\\n\\n\"Why, how true that is,\" he said, \"and I never thought of it. Sir,\\nyou have an intellect beyond the common. You will make a name.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re as drunk as an owl!\" said the Doctor.\\n\\n\"It only remains,\" continued Syme quite unperturbed, \"to adopt\\nsome other method of breaking the ice (if I may so express it)\\nbetween myself and the man I wish to kill. And since the course of\\na dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone (as you\\nhave pointed out with such recondite acumen), the only thing to be\\ndone, I suppose, is for the one party, as far as possible, to do\\nall the dialogue by himself. And so I will, by George!\" And he\\nstood up suddenly, his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea\\nbreeze.\\n\\nA band was playing in a cafe chantant hidden somewhere among the\\ntrees, and a woman had just stopped singing. On Syme\\'s heated head\\nthe bray of the brass band seemed like the jar and jingle of that\\nbarrel-organ in Leicester Square, to the tune of which he had once\\nstood up to die. He looked across to the little table where the\\nMarquis sat. The man had two companions now, solemn Frenchmen in\\nfrock-coats and silk hats, one of them with the red rosette of the\\nLegion of Honour, evidently people of a solid social position.\\nBesides these black, cylindrical costumes, the Marquis, in his\\nloose straw hat and light spring clothes, looked Bohemian and even\\nbarbaric; but he looked the Marquis. Indeed, one might say that he\\nlooked the king, with his animal elegance, his scornful eyes, and\\nhis proud head lifted against the purple sea. But he was no\\nChristian king, at any rate; he was, rather, some swarthy despot,\\nhalf Greek, half Asiatic, who in the days when slavery seemed\\nnatural looked down on the Mediterranean, on his galley and his\\ngroaning slaves. Just so, Syme thought, would the brown-gold face\\nof such a tyrant have shown against the dark green olives and the\\nburning blue.\\n\\n\"Are you going to address the meeting?\" asked the Professor\\npeevishly, seeing that Syme still stood up without moving.\\n\\nSyme drained his last glass of sparkling wine.\\n\\n\"I am,\" he said, pointing across to the Marquis and his companions,\\n\"that meeting. That meeting displeases me. I am going to pull that\\nmeeting\\'s great ugly, mahogany-coloured nose.\"\\n\\nHe stepped across swiftly, if not quite steadily. The Marquis,\\nseeing him, arched his black Assyrian eyebrows in surprise, but\\nsmiled politely.\\n\\n\"You are Mr. Syme, I think,\" he said.\\n\\nSyme bowed.\\n\\n\"And you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache,\" he said gracefully.\\n\"Permit me to pull your nose.\"\\n\\nHe leant over to do so, but the Marquis started backwards,\\nupsetting his chair, and the two men in top hats held Syme back\\nby the shoulders.\\n\\n\"This man has insulted me!\" said Syme, with gestures of\\nexplanation.\\n\\n\"Insulted you?\" cried the gentleman with the red rosette, \"when?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, just now,\" said Syme recklessly. \"He insulted my mother.\"\\n\\n\"Insulted your mother!\" exclaimed the gentleman incredulously.\\n\\n\"Well, anyhow,\" said Syme, conceding a point, \"my aunt.\"\\n\\n\"But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now?\" said\\nthe second gentleman with some legitimate wonder. \"He has been\\nsitting here all the time.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, it was what he said!\" said Syme darkly.\\n\\n\"I said nothing at all,\" said the Marquis, \"except something\\nabout the band. I only said that I liked Wagner played well.\"\\n\\n\"It was an allusion to my family,\" said Syme firmly. \"My aunt\\nplayed Wagner badly. It was a painful subject. We are always\\nbeing insulted about it.\"\\n\\n\"This seems most extraordinary,\" said the gentleman who was\\ndecore, looking doubtfully at the Marquis.\\n\\n\"Oh, I assure you,\" said Syme earnestly, \"the whole of your\\nconversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my\\naunt\\'s weaknesses.\"\\n\\n\"This is nonsense!\" said the second gentleman. \"I for one have\\nsaid nothing for half an hour except that I liked the singing of\\nthat girl with black hair.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there you are again!\" said Syme indignantly. \"My aunt\\'s was\\nred.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me,\" said the other, \"that you are simply seeking a\\npretext to insult the Marquis.\"\\n\\n\"By George!\" said Syme, facing round and looking at him, \"what a\\nclever chap you are!\"\\n\\nThe Marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tiger\\'s.\\n\\n\"Seeking a quarrel with me!\" he cried. \"Seeking a fight with me! By\\nGod! there was never a man who had to seek long. These gentlemen\\nwill perhaps act for me. There are still four hours of daylight.\\nLet us fight this evening.\"\\n\\nSyme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness.\\n\\n\"Marquis,\" he said, \"your action is worthy of your fame and blood.\\nPermit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose\\nhands I shall place myself.\"\\n\\nIn three long strides he rejoined his companions, and they, who\\nhad seen his champagne-inspired attack and listened to his idiotic\\nexplanations, were quite startled at the look of him. For now that\\nhe came back to them he was quite sober, a little pale, and he\\nspoke in a low voice of passionate practicality.\\n\\n\"I have done it,\" he said hoarsely. \"I have fixed a fight on the\\nbeast. But look here, and listen carefully. There is no time for\\ntalk. You are my seconds, and everything must come from you. Now\\nyou must insist, and insist absolutely, on the duel coming off\\nafter seven tomorrow, so as to give me the chance of preventing him\\nfrom catching the 7.45 for Paris. If he misses that he misses his\\ncrime. He can\\'t refuse to meet you on such a small point of time\\nand place. But this is what he will do. He will choose a field\\nsomewhere near a wayside station, where he can pick up the train.\\nHe is a very good swordsman, and he will trust to killing me in\\ntime to catch it. But I can fence well too, and I think I can keep\\nhim in play, at any rate, until the train is lost. Then perhaps he\\nmay kill me to console his feelings. You understand? Very well\\nthen, let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine,\" and\\nleading them quickly across the parade, he presented them to the\\nMarquis\\'s seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had\\nnot previously heard.\\n\\nSyme was subject to spasms of singular common sense, not otherwise\\na part of his character. They were (as he said of his impulse about\\nthe spectacles) poetic intuitions, and they sometimes rose to the\\nexaltation of prophecy.\\n\\nHe had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his\\nopponent. When the Marquis was informed by his seconds that Syme\\ncould only fight in the morning, he must fully have realised that\\nan obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb-throwing\\nbusiness in the capital. Naturally he could not explain this\\nobjection to his friends, so he chose the course which Syme had\\npredicted. He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not\\nfar from the railway, and he trusted to the fatality of the first\\nengagement.\\n\\nWhen he came down very coolly to the field of honour, no one could\\nhave guessed that he had any anxiety about a journey; his hands\\nwere in his pockets, his straw hat on the back of his head, his\\nhandsome face brazen in the sun. But it might have struck a\\nstranger as odd that there appeared in his train, not only his\\nseconds carrying the sword-case, but two of his servants carrying\\na portmanteau and a luncheon basket.\\n\\nEarly as was the hour, the sun soaked everything in warmth, and\\nSyme was vaguely surprised to see so many spring flowers burning\\ngold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole company stood\\nalmost knee-deep.\\n\\nWith the exception of the Marquis, all the men were in sombre and\\nsolemn morning-dress, with hats like black chimney-pots; the little\\nDoctor especially, with the addition of his black spectacles,\\nlooked like an undertaker in a farce. Syme could not help feeling a\\ncomic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and\\nthe rich and glistening meadow, growing wild flowers everywhere.\\nBut, indeed, this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and\\nthe black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the\\nyellow blossoms and the black business. On his right was a little\\nwood; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line,\\nwhich he was, so to speak, guarding from the Marquis, whose goal\\nand escape it was. In front of him, behind the black group of his\\nopponents, he could see, like a tinted cloud, a small almond bush\\nin flower against the faint line of the sea.\\n\\nThe member of the Legion of Honour, whose name it seemed was\\nColonel Ducroix, approached the Professor and Dr. Bull with great\\npoliteness, and suggested that the play should terminate with the\\nfirst considerable hurt.\\n\\nDr. Bull, however, having been carefully coached by Syme upon this\\npoint of policy, insisted, with great dignity and in very bad\\nFrench, that it should continue until one of the combatants was\\ndisabled. Syme had made up his mind that he could avoid disabling\\nthe Marquis and prevent the Marquis from disabling him for at\\nleast twenty minutes. In twenty minutes the Paris train would have\\ngone by.\\n\\n\"To a man of the well-known skill and valour of Monsieur de St.\\nEustache,\" said the Professor solemnly, \"it must be a matter of\\nindifference which method is adopted, and our principal has strong\\nreasons for demanding the longer encounter, reasons the delicacy\\nof which prevent me from being explicit, but for the just and\\nhonourable nature of which I can--\"\\n\\n\"Peste!\" broke from the Marquis behind, whose face had suddenly\\ndarkened, \"let us stop talking and begin,\" and he slashed off the\\nhead of a tall flower with his stick.\\n\\nSyme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over\\nhis shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight. But\\nthere was no smoke on the horizon.\\n\\nColonel Ducroix knelt down and unlocked the case, taking out a\\npair of twin swords, which took the sunlight and turned to two\\nstreaks of white fire. He offered one to the Marquis, who snatched\\nit without ceremony, and another to Syme, who took it, bent it,\\nand poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity.\\n\\nThen the Colonel took out another pair of blades, and taking one\\nhimself and giving another to Dr. Bull, proceeded to place the\\nmen.\\n\\nBoth combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats, and\\nstood sword in hand. The seconds stood on each side of the line\\nof fight with drawn swords also, but still sombre in their dark\\nfrock-coats and hats. The principals saluted. The Colonel said\\nquietly, \"Engage!\" and the two blades touched and tingled.\\n\\nWhen the jar of the joined iron ran up Syme\\'s arm, all the\\nfantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell\\nfrom him like dreams from a man waking up in bed. He remembered\\nthem clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves--how\\nthe fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic\\naccidents of nightmare, and how the fear of the Doctor had been\\nthe fear of the airless vacuum of science. The first was the old\\nfear that any miracle might happen, the second the more hopeless\\nmodern fear that no miracle can ever happen. But he saw that\\nthese fears were fancies, for he found himself in the presence of\\nthe great fact of the fear of death, with its coarse and pitiless\\ncommon sense. He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of\\nfalling over precipices, and had woke up on the morning when he\\nwas to be hanged. For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run\\ndown the channel of his foe\\'s foreshortened blade, and as soon as\\nhe had felt the two tongues of steel touch, vibrating like two\\nliving things, he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter, and\\nthat probably his last hour had come.\\n\\nHe felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him, in\\nthe grass under his feet; he felt the love of life in all living\\nthings. He could almost fancy that he heard the grass growing; he\\ncould almost fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were\\nspringing up and breaking into blossom in the meadow--flowers blood\\nred and burning gold and blue, fulfilling the whole pageant of the\\nspring. And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm,\\nstaring, hypnotic eyes of the Marquis, they saw the little tuft of\\nalmond tree against the sky-line. He had the feeling that if by\\nsome miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before\\nthat almond tree, desiring nothing else in the world.\\n\\nBut while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a\\nthing lost, the other half of his head was as clear as glass, and\\nhe was parrying his enemy\\'s point with a kind of clockwork skill of\\nwhich he had hardly supposed himself capable. Once his enemy\\'s\\npoint ran along his wrist, leaving a slight streak of blood, but it\\neither was not noticed or was tacitly ignored. Every now and then\\nhe riposted, and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt\\nhis point go home, but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he\\nsupposed he was mistaken. Then came an interruption and a change.\\n\\nAt the risk of losing all, the Marquis, interrupting his quiet\\nstare, flashed one glance over his shoulder at the line of railway\\non his right. Then he turned on Syme a face transfigured to that of\\na fiend, and began to fight as if with twenty weapons. The attack\\ncame so fast and furious, that the one shining sword seemed a\\nshower of shining arrows. Syme had no chance to look at the\\nrailway; but also he had no need. He could guess the reason of the\\nMarquis\\'s sudden madness of battle--the Paris train was in sight.\\n\\nBut the Marquis\\'s morbid energy over-reached itself. Twice Syme,\\nparrying, knocked his opponent\\'s point far out of the fighting\\ncircle; and the third time his riposte was so rapid, that there\\nwas no doubt about the hit this time. Syme\\'s sword actually bent\\nunder the weight of the Marquis\\'s body, which it had pierced.\\n\\nSyme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as\\na gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground. Yet the\\nMarquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger, and Syme\\nstood staring at his own sword-point like an idiot. There was no\\nblood on it at all.\\n\\nThere was an instant of rigid silence, and then Syme in his turn\\nfell furiously on the other, filled with a flaming curiosity. The\\nMarquis was probably, in a general sense, a better fencer than he,\\nas he had surmised at the beginning, but at the moment the Marquis\\nseemed distraught and at a disadvantage. He fought wildly and even\\nweakly, and he constantly looked away at the railway line, almost\\nas if he feared the train more than the pointed steel. Syme, on the\\nother hand, fought fiercely but still carefully, in an intellectual\\nfury, eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword. For\\nthis purpose, he aimed less at the Marquis\\'s body, and more at his\\nthroat and head. A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point\\nenter the man\\'s neck below the jaw. It came out clean. Half mad, he\\nthrust again, and made what should have been a bloody scar on the\\nMarquis\\'s cheek. But there was no scar.\\n\\nFor one moment the heaven of Syme again grew black with\\nsupernatural terrors. Surely the man had a charmed life. But this\\nnew spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere\\nspiritual topsy-turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued\\nhim. The Professor was only a goblin; this man was a devil--perhaps\\nhe was the Devil! Anyhow, this was certain, that three times had a\\nhuman sword been driven into him and made no mark. When Syme had\\nthat thought he drew himself up, and all that was good in him sang\\nhigh up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees. He thought of\\nall the human things in his story--of the Chinese lanterns in\\nSaffron Park, of the girl\\'s red hair in the garden, of the honest,\\nbeer-swilling sailors down by the dock, of his loyal companions\\nstanding by. Perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these\\nfresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all\\ncreation. \"After all,\" he said to himself, \"I am more than a devil;\\nI am a man. I can do the one thing which Satan himself cannot do--I\\ncan die,\" and as the word went through his head, he heard a faint\\nand far-off hoot, which would soon be the roar of the Paris train.\\n\\nHe fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity, like a\\nMohammedan panting for Paradise. As the train came nearer and\\nnearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral\\narches in Paris; he joined in the growing noise and the glory of\\nthe great Republic whose gate he was guarding against Hell. His\\nthoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the\\ntrain, which ended, as if proudly, in a long and piercing\\nwhistle. The train stopped.\\n\\nSuddenly, to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back\\nquite out of sword reach and threw down his sword. The leap was\\nwonderful, and not the less wonderful because Syme had plunged his\\nsword a moment before into the man\\'s thigh.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary\\nobedience. \"I want to say something.\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Colonel Ducroix, staring. \"Has there\\nbeen foul play?\"\\n\\n\"There has been foul play somewhere,\" said Dr. Bull, who was a\\nlittle pale. \"Our principal has wounded the Marquis four times\\nat least, and he is none the worse .\"\\n\\nThe Marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly\\npatience.\\n\\n\"Please let me speak,\" he said. \"It is rather important. Mr.\\nSyme,\" he continued, turning to his opponent, \"we are fighting\\ntoday, if I remember right, because you expressed a wish (which\\nI thought irrational) to pull my nose. Would you oblige me by\\npulling my nose now as quickly as possible? I have to catch a\\ntrain.\"\\n\\n\"I protest that this is most irregular,\" said Dr. Bull\\nindignantly.\\n\\n\"It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent,\" said Colonel\\nDucroix, looking wistfully at his principal. \"There is, I think,\\none case on record (Captain Bellegarde and the Baron Zumpt) in\\nwhich the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at\\nthe request of one of the combatants. But one can hardly call\\none\\'s nose a weapon.\"\\n\\n\"Will you or will you not pull my nose?\" said the Marquis in\\nexasperation. \"Come, come, Mr. Syme! You wanted to do it, do it!\\nYou can have no conception of how important it is to me. Don\\'t be\\nso selfish! Pull my nose at once, when I ask you!\" and he bent\\nslightly forward with a fascinating smile. The Paris train,\\npanting and groaning, had grated into a little station behind the\\nneighbouring hill.\\n\\nSyme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures\\n--the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was\\njust toppling over. Walking in a world he half understood, he took\\ntwo paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this remarkable\\nnobleman. He pulled it hard, and it came off in his hand.\\n\\nHe stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity, with the\\npasteboard proboscis still between his fingers, looking at it,\\nwhile the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down\\nupon this imbecile scene.\\n\\nThe Marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice.\\n\\n\"If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow,\" he said, \"he can have\\nit. Colonel Ducroix, do accept my left eyebrow! It\\'s the kind of\\nthing that might come in useful any day,\" and he gravely tore off\\none of his swarthy Assyrian brows, bringing about half his brown\\nforehead with it, and politely offered it to the Colonel, who\\nstood crimson and speechless with rage.\\n\\n\"If I had known,\" he spluttered, \"that I was acting for a poltroon\\nwho pads himself to fight--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I know, I know!\" said the Marquis, recklessly throwing various\\nparts of himself right and left about the field. \"You are making a\\nmistake; but it can\\'t be explained just now. I tell you the train\\nhas come into the station!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Dr. Bull fiercely, \"and the train shall go out of the\\nstation. It shall go out without you. We know well enough for what\\ndevil\\'s work--\"\\n\\nThe mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture.\\nHe was a strange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his\\nold face peeled off, and half another face glaring and grinning\\nfrom underneath.\\n\\n\"Will you drive me mad?\" he cried. \"The train--\"\\n\\n\"You shall not go by the train,\" said Syme firmly, and grasped his\\nsword.\\n\\nThe wild figure turned towards Syme, and seemed to be gathering\\nitself for a sublime effort before speaking.\\n\\n\"You great fat, blasted, blear-eyed, blundering, thundering,\\nbrainless, Godforsaken, doddering, damned fool!\" he said without\\ntaking breath. \"You great silly, pink-faced, towheaded turnip!\\nYou--\"\\n\\n\"You shall not go by this train,\" repeated Syme.\\n\\n\"And why the infernal blazes,\" roared the other, \"should I want to\\ngo by the train?\"\\n\\n\"We know all,\" said the Professor sternly. \"You are going to Paris\\nto throw a bomb!\"\\n\\n\"Going to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock!\" cried the other, tearing\\nhis hair, which came off easily.\\n\\n\"Have you all got softening of the brain, that you don\\'t realise\\nwhat I am? Did you really think I wanted to catch that train?\\nTwenty Paris trains might go by for me. Damn Paris trains!\"\\n\\n\"Then what did you care about?\" began the Professor.\\n\\n\"What did I care about? I didn\\'t care about catching the train; I\\ncared about whether the train caught me, and now, by God! it has\\ncaught me.\"\\n\\n\"I regret to inform you,\" said Syme with restraint, \"that your\\nremarks convey no impression to my mind. Perhaps if you were to\\nremove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of\\nwhat was once your chin, your meaning would become clearer. Mental\\nlucidity fulfils itself in many ways. What do you mean by saying\\nthat the train has caught you? It may be my literary fancy, but\\nsomehow I feel that it ought to mean something.\"\\n\\n\"It means everything,\" said the other, \"and the end of everything.\\nSunday has us now in the hollow of his hand.\"\\n\\n\"Us!\" repeated the Professor, as if stupefied. \"What do you mean by\\n\\'us\\'?\"\\n\\n\"The police, of course!\" said the Marquis, and tore off his scalp\\nand half his face.\\n\\nThe head which emerged was the blonde, well brushed, smooth-haired\\nhead which is common in the English constabulary, but the face was\\nterribly pale.\\n\\n\"I am Inspector Ratcliffe,\" he said, with a sort of haste that\\nverged on harshness. \"My name is pretty well known to the police,\\nand I can see well enough that you belong to them. But if there is\\nany doubt about my position, I have a card\" and he began to pull a\\nblue card from his pocket.\\n\\nThe Professor gave a tired gesture.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t show it us,\" he said wearily; \"we\\'ve got enough of them\\nto equip a paper-chase.\"\\n\\nThe little man named Bull, had, like many men who seem to be of a\\nmere vivacious vulgarity, sudden movements of good taste. Here he\\ncertainly saved the situation. In the midst of this staggering\\ntransformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and\\nresponsibility of a second, and addressed the two seconds of the\\nMarquis.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"we all owe you a serious apology; but I\\nassure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low\\njoke as you imagine, or indeed of anything undignified in a man of\\nhonour. You have not wasted your time; you have helped to save the\\nworld. We are not buffoons, but very desperate men at war with a\\nvast conspiracy. A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like\\nhares; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a\\nbomb through starvation or German philosophy, but a rich and\\npowerful and fanatical church, a church of eastern pessimism, which\\nholds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin. How hard they hunt us\\nyou can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises\\nas those for which I apologise, and to such pranks as this one by\\nwhich you suffer. \"\\n\\nThe younger second of the Marquis, a short man with a black\\nmoustache, bowed politely, and said--\\n\\n\"Of course, I accept the apology; but you will in your turn forgive\\nme if I decline to follow you further into your difficulties, and\\npermit myself to say good morning! The sight of an acquaintance and\\ndistinguished fellow-townsman coming to pieces in the open air is\\nunusual, and, upon the whole, sufficient for one day. Colonel\\nDucroix, I would in no way influence your actions, but if you feel\\nwith me that our present society is a little abnormal, I am now\\ngoing to walk back to the town.\"\\n\\nColonel Ducroix moved mechanically, but then tugged abruptly at his\\nwhite moustache and broke out--\\n\\n\"No, by George! I won\\'t. If these gentlemen are really in a mess\\nwith a lot of low wreckers like that, I\\'ll see them through it. I\\nhave fought for France, and it is hard if I can\\'t fight for\\ncivilization.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull took off his hat and waved it, cheering as at a public\\nmeeting.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make too much noise,\" said Inspector Ratcliffe, \"Sunday may\\nhear you.\"\\n\\n\"Sunday!\" cried Bull, and dropped his hat.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" retorted Ratcliffe, \"he may be with them.\"\\n\\n\"With whom?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"With the people out of that train,\" said the other.\\n\\n\"What you say seems utterly wild,\" began Syme. \"Why, as a matter of\\nfact--But, my God,\" he cried out suddenly, like a man who sees an\\nexplosion a long way off, \"by God! if this is true the whole bally\\nlot of us on the Anarchist Council were against anarchy! Every born\\nman was a detective except the President and his personal\\nsecretary. What can it mean?\"\\n\\n\"Mean!\" said the new policeman with incredible violence. \"It means\\nthat we are struck dead! Don\\'t you know Sunday? Don\\'t you know that\\nhis jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought\\nof them? Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this, that\\nhe should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council, and\\nthen take care that it was not supreme? I tell you he has bought\\nevery trust, he has captured every cable, he has control of every\\nrailway line--especially of that railway line!\" and he pointed a\\nshaking finger towards the small wayside station. \"The whole\\nmovement was controlled by him; half the world was ready to rise\\nfor him. But there were just five people, perhaps, who would have\\nresisted him . . . and the old devil put them on the Supreme\\nCouncil, to waste their time in watching each other. Idiots that\\nwe are, he planned the whole of our idiocies! Sunday knew that the\\nProfessor would chase Syme through London, and that Syme would\\nfight me in France. And he was combining great masses of capital,\\nand seizing great lines of telegraphy, while we five idiots were\\nrunning after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing\\nblind man\\'s buff.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" asked Syme with a sort of steadiness.\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied the other with sudden serenity, \"he has found us\\nplaying blind man\\'s buff today in a field of great rustic beauty\\nand extreme solitude. He has probably captured the world; it only\\nremains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it. And\\nsince you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival\\nof that train, I will tell you. My objection was that Sunday or his\\nSecretary has just this moment got out of it.\"\\n\\nSyme uttered an involuntary cry, and they all turned their eyes\\ntowards the far-off station. It was quite true that a considerable\\nbulk of people seemed to be moving in their direction. But they\\nwere too distant to be distinguished in any way.\\n\\n\"It was a habit of the late Marquis de St. Eustache,\" said the new\\npoliceman, producing a leather case, \"always to carry a pair of\\nopera glasses. Either the President or the Secretary is coming\\nafter us with that mob. They have caught us in a nice quiet place\\nwhere we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling\\nthe police. Dr. Bull, I have a suspicion that you will see better\\nthrough these than through your own highly decorative spectacles.\"\\n\\nHe handed the field-glasses to the Doctor, who immediately took\\noff his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes.\\n\\n\"It cannot be as bad as you say,\" said the Professor, somewhat\\nshaken. \"There are a good number of them certainly, but they may\\neasily be ordinary tourists.\"\\n\\n\"Do ordinary tourists,\" asked Bull, with the fieldglasses to his\\neyes, \"wear black masks half-way down the face?\"\\n\\nSyme almost tore the glasses out of his hand, and looked through\\nthem. Most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough;\\nbut it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front\\nwore black half-masks almost down to their mouths. This disguise\\nis very complete, especially at such a distance, and Syme found\\nit impossible to conclude anything from the clean-shaven jaws and\\nchins of the men talking in the front. But presently as they\\ntalked they all smiled and one of them smiled on one side.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nTHE CRIMINALS CHASE THE POLICE\\n\\nSYME put the field-glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly\\nrelief.\\n\\n\"The President is not with them, anyhow,\" he said, and wiped his\\nforehead.\\n\\n\"But surely they are right away on the horizon,\" said the\\nbewildered Colonel, blinking and but half recovered from Bull\\'s\\nhasty though polite explanation. \"Could you possibly know your\\nPresident among all those people?\"\\n\\n\"Could I know a white elephant among all those people!\" answered\\nSyme somewhat irritably. \"As you very truly say, they are on the\\nhorizon; but if he were walking with them . . . by God! I believe\\nthis ground would shake.\"\\n\\nAfter an instant\\'s pause the new man called Ratcliffe said with\\ngloomy decision--\\n\\n\"Of course the President isn\\'t with them. I wish to Gemini he were.\\nMuch more likely the President is riding in triumph through Paris,\\nor sitting on the ruins of St. Paul\\'s Cathedral.\"\\n\\n\"This is absurd!\" said Syme. \"Something may have happened in our\\nabsence; but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like\\nthat. It is quite true,\" he added, frowning dubiously at the\\ndistant fields that lay towards the little station, \"it is\\ncertainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way;\\nbut they are not all the army that you make out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they,\" said the new detective contemptuously; \"no they are\\nnot a very valuable force. But let me tell you frankly that they\\nare precisely calculated to our value--we are not much, my boy,\\nin Sunday\\'s universe. He has got hold of all the cables and\\ntelegraphs himself. But to kill the Supreme Council he regards as\\na trivial matter, like a post card; it may be left to his private\\nsecretary,\" and he spat on the grass.\\n\\nThen he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely--\\n\\n\"There is a great deal to be said for death; but if anyone has\\nany preference for the other alternative, I strongly advise him\\nto walk after me.\"\\n\\nWith these words, he turned his broad back and strode with silent\\nenergy towards the wood. The others gave one glance over their\\nshoulders, and saw that the dark cloud of men had detached itself\\nfrom the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline\\nacross the plain. They saw already, even with the naked eye, black\\nblots on the foremost faces, which marked the masks they wore.\\nThey turned and followed their leader, who had already struck the\\nwood, and disappeared among the twinkling trees.\\n\\nThe sun on the grass was dry and hot. So in plunging into the wood\\nthey had a cool shock of shadow, as of divers who plunge into a\\ndim pool. The inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight\\nand shaken shadows. They made a sort of shuddering veil, almost\\nrecalling the dizziness of a cinematograph. Even the solid figures\\nwalking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and\\nshade that danced upon them. Now a man\\'s head was lit as with a\\nlight of Rembrandt, leaving all else obliterated; now again he had\\nstrong and staring white hands with the face of a negro. The\\nex-Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes, and the\\nblack shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it\\nseemed to be wearing one of the black half-masks of their pursuers.\\nThe fancy tinted Syme\\'s overwhelming sense of wonder. Was he\\nwearing a mask? Was anyone wearing a mask? Was anyone anything?\\nThis wood of witchery, in which men\\'s faces turned black and white\\nby turns, in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and\\nthen faded into formless night, this mere chaos of chiaroscuro\\n(after the clear daylight outside), seemed to Syme a perfect symbol\\nof the world in which he had been moving for three days, this world\\nwhere men took off their beards and their spectacles and their\\nnoses, and turned into other people. That tragic self-confidence\\nwhich he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil\\nhad strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was\\na friend. He felt almost inclined to ask after all these\\nbewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy. Was there\\nanything that was apart from what it seemed? The Marquis had taken\\noff his nose and turned out to be a detective. Might he not just\\nas well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin? Was not\\neverything, after all, like this bewildering woodland, this dance\\nof dark and light? Everything only a glimpse, the glimpse always\\nunforeseen, and always forgotten. For Gabriel Syme had found in\\nthe heart of that sun-splashed wood what many modern painters had\\nfound there. He had found the thing which the modern people call\\nImpressionism, which is another name for that final scepticism\\nwhich can find no floor to the universe.\\n\\nAs a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake, Syme\\nstrove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of\\nhis fancies. With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the\\nMarquis\\'s straw hat, the man whom he had come to address as\\nRatcliffe. In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful, he broke\\nthe bottomless silence and made conversation.\\n\\n\"May I ask,\" he said, \"where on earth we are all going to? \"\\n\\nSo genuine had been the doubts of his soul, that he was quite glad\\nto hear his companion speak in an easy, human voice.\\n\\n\"We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea,\" he said.\\n\"I think that part of the country is least likely to be with\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"What can you mean by all this?\" cried Syme. \"They can\\'t be\\nrunning the real world in that way. Surely not many working men\\nare anarchists, and surely if they were, mere mobs could not beat\\nmodern armies and police.\"\\n\\n\"Mere mobs!\" repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn. \"So\\nyou talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the\\nquestion. You\\'ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy\\ncame it would come from the poor. Why should it? The poor have\\nbeen rebels, but they have never been anarchists; they have more\\ninterest than anyone else in there being some decent government.\\nThe poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man\\nhasn\\'t; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have\\nsometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always\\nobjected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always\\nanarchists, as you can see from the barons\\' wars.\"\\n\\n\"As a lecture on English history for the little ones,\" said Syme,\\n\"this is all very nice; but I have not yet grasped its application.\"\\n\\n\"Its application is,\" said his informant, \"that most of old Sunday\\'s\\nright-hand men are South African and American millionaires. That is\\nwhy he has got hold of all the communications; and that is why the\\nlast four champions of the anti-anarchist police force are running\\nthrough a wood like rabbits.\"\\n\\n\"Millionaires I can understand,\" said Syme thoughtfully, \"they are\\nnearly all mad. But getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with\\nhobbies is one thing; getting hold of great Christian nations is\\nanother. I would bet the nose off my face (forgive the allusion)\\nthat Sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of\\nconverting any ordinary healthy person anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"it rather depends what sort of person you\\nmean.\"\\n\\n\"Well, for instance,\" said Syme, \"he could never convert that\\nperson,\" and he pointed straight in front of him.\\n\\nThey had come to an open space of sunlight, which seemed to express\\nto Syme the final return of his own good sense; and in the middle\\nof this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that\\ncommon sense in an almost awful actuality. Burnt by the sun and\\nstained with perspiration, and grave with the bottomless gravity of\\nsmall necessary toils, a heavy French peasant was cutting wood with\\na hatchet. His cart stood a few yards off, already half full of\\ntimber; and the horse that cropped the grass was, like his master,\\nvalorous but not desperate; like his master, he was even\\nprosperous, but yet was almost sad. The man was a Norman, taller\\nthan the average of the French and very angular; and his swarthy\\nfigure stood dark against a square of sunlight, almost like some\\nallegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of gold.\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme is saying,\" called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel,\\n\"that this man, at least, will never be an anarchist.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme is right enough there,\" answered Colonel Ducroix,\\nlaughing, \"if only for the reason that he has plenty of property\\nto defend. But I forgot that in your country you are not used to\\npeasants being wealthy.\"\\n\\n\"He looks poor,\" said Dr. Bull doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" said the Colonel; \"that is why he is rich.\"\\n\\n\"I have an idea,\" called out Dr. Bull suddenly; \"how much would he\\ntake to give us a lift in his cart? Those dogs are all on foot, and\\nwe could soon leave them behind.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, give him anything!\" said Syme eagerly. \"I have piles of money\\non me.\"\\n\\n\"That will never do,\" said the Colonel; \"he will never have any\\nrespect for you unless you drive a bargain.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if he haggles!\" began Bull impatiently.\\n\\n\"Erie haggles because he is a free man,\" said the other. \"You do\\nnot understand; he would not see the meaning of generosity. He is\\nnot being tipped.\"\\n\\nAnd even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange\\npursuers behind them, they had to stand and stamp while the French\\nColonel talked to the French wood-cutter with all the leisurely\\nbadinage and bickering of market-day. At the end of the four\\nminutes, however, they saw that the Colonel was right, for the\\nwood-cutter entered into their plans, not with the vague servility\\nof a tout too-well paid, but with the seriousness of a solicitor\\nwho had been paid the proper fee. He told them that the best thing\\nthey could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the\\nhills above Lancy, where the innkeeper, an old soldier who had\\nbecome devot in his latter years, would be certain to sympathise\\nwith them, and even to take risks in their support. The whole\\ncompany, therefore, piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood,\\nand went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side\\nof the woodland. Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle, it was\\ndriven quickly enough, and they soon had the exhilarating\\nimpression of distancing altogether those, whoever they were, who\\nwere hunting them. For, after all, the riddle as to where the\\nanarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved. One\\nman\\'s presence had sufficed for them; they had fled at the first\\nsight of the deformed smile of the Secretary. Syme every now and\\nthen looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track.\\n\\nAs the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance, he\\ncould see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it; and across\\nthese was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous\\nbeetle. In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong\\neyes, which were almost telescopic, Syme could see this mass of\\nmen quite plainly. He could see them as separate human figures;\\nbut he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved\\nas one man. They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain\\nhats, like any common crowd out of the streets; but they did not\\nspread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack, as\\nwould be natural in an ordinary mob. They moved with a sort of\\ndreadful and wicked woodenness, like a staring army of automatons.\\n\\nSyme pointed this out to Ratcliffe.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the policeman, \"that\\'s discipline. That\\'s Sunday. He\\nis perhaps five hundred miles off, but the fear of him is on all of\\nthem, like the finger of God. Yes, they are walking regularly; and\\nyou bet your boots that they are talking regularly, yes, and\\nthinking regularly. But the one important thing for us is that they\\nare disappearing regularly.\"\\n\\nSyme nodded. It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men\\nwas growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his\\nhorse.\\n\\nThe level of the sunlit landscape, though flat as a whole, fell\\naway on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope\\ntowards the sea, in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the\\nSussex downs. The only difference was that in Sussex the road\\nwould have been broken and angular like a little brook, but\\nhere the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a\\nwaterfall. Down this direct descent the cart clattered at a\\nconsiderable angle, and in a few minutes, the road growing yet\\nsteeper, they saw below them the little harbour of Lancy and a\\ngreat blue arc of the sea. The travelling cloud of their enemies\\nhad wholly disappeared from the horizon.\\n\\nThe horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms, and\\nthe horse\\'s nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who\\nwas sitting on the benches outside the little cafe of \"Le Soleil\\nd\\'Or.\" The peasant grunted an apology, and got down from his\\nseat. The others also descended one by one, and spoke to the old\\ngentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy, for it was quite\\nevident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the\\nlittle tavern.\\n\\nHe was a white-haired, apple-faced old boy, with sleepy eyes and\\na grey moustache; stout, sedentary, and very innocent, of a type\\nthat may often be found in France, but is still commoner in\\nCatholic Germany. Everything about him, his pipe, his pot of beer,\\nhis flowers, and his beehive, suggested an ancestral peace; only\\nwhen his visitors looked up as they entered the inn-parlour, they\\nsaw the sword upon the wall.\\n\\nThe Colonel, who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend, passed\\nrapidly into the inn-parlour, and sat down ordering some ritual\\nrefreshment. The military decision of his action interested Syme,\\nwho sat next to him, and he took the opportunity when the old\\ninnkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity.\\n\\n\"May I ask you, Colonel,\" he said in a low voice, \"why we have\\ncome here?\"\\n\\nColonel Ducroix smiled behind his bristly white moustache.\\n\\n\"For two reasons, sir,\" he said; \"and I will give first, not the\\nmost important, but the most utilitarian. We came here because\\nthis is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get\\nhorses.\"\\n\\n\"Horses!\" repeated Syme, looking up quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the other; \"if you people are really to distance\\nyour enemies it is horses or nothing for you, unless of course\\nyou have bicycles and motor-cars in your pocket.\"\\n\\n\"And where do you advise us to make for?\" asked Syme doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Beyond question,\" replied the Colonel, \"you had better make all\\nhaste to the police station beyond the town. My friend, whom I\\nseconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances, seems to me to\\nexaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising; but\\neven he would hardly maintain, I suppose, that you were not safe\\nwith the gendarmes.\"\\n\\nSyme nodded gravely; then he said abruptly--\\n\\n\"And your other reason for coming here?\"\\n\\n\"My other reason for coming here,\" said Ducroix soberly, \"is that\\nit is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly\\nnear to death.\"\\n\\nSyme looked up at the wall, and saw a crudely-painted and pathetic\\nreligious picture. Then he said--\\n\\n\"You are right,\" and then almost immediately afterwards, \"Has\\nanyone seen about the horses?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Ducroix, \"you may be quite certain that I gave\\norders the moment I came in. Those enemies of yours gave no\\nimpression of hurry, but they were really moving wonderfully fast,\\nlike a well-trained army. I had no idea that the anarchists had so\\nmuch discipline. You have not a moment to waste.\"\\n\\nAlmost as he spoke, the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white\\nhair came ambling into the room, and announced that six horses\\nwere saddled outside.\\n\\nBy Ducroix\\'s advice the five others equipped themselves with some\\nportable form of food and wine, and keeping their duelling swords\\nas the only weapons available, they clattered away down the steep,\\nwhite road. The two servants, who had carried the Marquis\\'s\\nluggage when he was a marquis, were left behind to drink at the\\ncafe by common consent, and not at all against their own\\ninclination.\\n\\nBy this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward, and by its\\nrays Syme could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing\\nsmaller and smaller, but still standing and looking after them\\nquite silently, the sunshine in his silver hair. Syme had a fixed,\\nsuperstitious fancy, left in his mind by the chance phrase of the\\nColonel, that this was indeed, perhaps, the last honest stranger\\nwhom he should ever see upon the earth.\\n\\nHe was still looking at this dwindling figure, which stood as a\\nmere grey blot touched with a white flame against the great green\\nwall of the steep down behind him. And as he stared over the top\\nof the down behind the innkeeper, there appeared an army of\\nblack-clad and marching men. They seemed to hang above the good\\nman and his house like a black cloud of locusts. The horses had\\nbeen saddled none too soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nTHE EARTH IN ANARCHY\\n\\nURGING the horses to a gallop, without respect to the rather\\nrugged descent of the road, the horsemen soon regained their\\nadvantage over the men on the march, and at last the bulk of the\\nfirst buildings of Lancy cut off the sight of their pursuers.\\nNevertheless, the ride had been a long one, and by the time they\\nreached the real town the west was warming with the colour and\\nquality of sunset. The Colonel suggested that, before making\\nfinally for the police station, they should make the effort, in\\npassing, to attach to themselves one more individual who might be\\nuseful.\\n\\n\"Four out of the five rich men in this town,\" he said, \"are common\\nswindlers. I suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the\\nworld. The fifth is a friend of mine, and a very fine fellow; and\\nwhat is even more important from our point of view, he owns a\\nmotor-car.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" said the Professor in his mirthful way, looking\\nback along the white road on which the black, crawling patch might\\nappear at any moment, \"I am afraid we have hardly time for\\nafternoon calls.\"\\n\\n\"Doctor Renard\\'s house is only three minutes off,\" said the\\nColonel.\\n\\n\"Our danger,\" said Dr. Bull, \"is not two minutes off.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme, \"if we ride on fast we must leave them behind,\\nfor they are on foot.\"\\n\\n\"He has a motor-car,\" said the Colonel.\\n\\n\"But we may not get it,\" said Bull.\\n\\n\"Yes, he is quite on your side.\"\\n\\n\"But he might be out.\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue,\" said Syme suddenly. \"What is that noise?\"\\n\\nFor a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues, and\\nfor a second--for two or three or four seconds--heaven and earth\\nseemed equally still. Then all their ears, in an agony of\\nattention, heard along the road that indescribable thrill and\\nthrob that means only one thing--horses!\\n\\nThe Colonel\\'s face had an instantaneous change, as if lightning\\nhad struck it, and yet left it scatheless.\\n\\n\"They have done us,\" he said, with brief military irony. \"Prepare\\nto receive cavalry!\"\\n\\n\"Where can they have got the horses?\" asked Syme, as he\\nmechanically urged his steed to a canter.\\n\\nThe Colonel was silent for a little, then he said in a strained\\nvoice--\\n\\n\"I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the \\'Soleil\\nd\\'Or\\' was the only place where one can get horses within twenty\\nmiles.\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Syme violently, \"I don\\'t believe he\\'d do it. Not with\\nall that white hair.\"\\n\\n\"He may have been forced,\" said the Colonel gently. \"They must be\\nat least a hundred strong, for which reason we are all going to\\nsee my friend Renard, who has a motor-car.\"\\n\\nWith these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street\\ncorner, and went down the street with such thundering speed, that\\nthe others, though already well at the gallop, had difficulty in\\nfollowing the flying tail of his horse.\\n\\nDr. Renard inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a\\nsteep street, so that when the riders alighted at his door they\\ncould once more see the solid green ridge of the hill, with the\\nwhite road across it, standing up above all the roofs of the town.\\nThey breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear, and they\\nrang the bell.\\n\\nDr. Renard was a beaming, brown-bearded man, a good example of that\\nsilent but very busy professional class which France has preserved\\neven more perfectly than England. When the matter was explained to\\nhim he pooh-poohed the panic of the ex-Marquis altogether; he said,\\nwith the solid French scepticism, that there was no conceivable\\nprobability of a general anarchist rising. \"Anarchy,\" he said,\\nshrugging his shoulders, \"it is childishness!\"\\n\\n\"Et ca,\" cried out the Colonel suddenly, pointing over the other\\'s\\nshoulder, \"and that is childishness, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nThey all looked round, and saw a curve of black cavalry come\\nsweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of Attila.\\nSwiftly as they rode, however, the whole rank still kept well\\ntogether, and they could see the black vizards of the first line\\nas level as a line of uniforms. But although the main black\\nsquare was the same, though travelling faster, there was now one\\nsensational difference which they could see clearly upon the slope\\nof the hill, as if upon a slanted map. The bulk of the riders were\\nin one block; but one rider flew far ahead of the column, and with\\nfrantic movements of hand and heel urged his horse faster and\\nfaster, so that one might have fancied that he was not the pursuer\\nbut the pursued. But even at that great distance they could see\\nsomething so fanatical, so unquestionable in his figure, that they\\nknew it was the Secretary himself. \"I am sorry to cut short a\\ncultured discussion,\" said the Colonel, \"but can you lend me your\\nmotor-car now, in two minutes?\"\\n\\n\"I have a suspicion that you are all mad,\" said Dr. Renard, smiling\\nsociably; \"but God forbid that madness should in any way interrupt\\nfriendship. Let us go round to the garage.\"\\n\\nDr. Renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth; his rooms were\\nlike the Musee de Cluny, and he had three motor-cars. These,\\nhowever, he seemed to use very sparingly, having the simple tastes\\nof the French middle class, and when his impatient friends came to\\nexamine them, it took them some time to assure themselves that one\\nof them even could be made to work. This with some difficulty they\\nbrought round into the street before the Doctor\\'s house. When they\\ncame out of the dim garage they were startled to find that\\ntwilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the\\ntropics. Either they had been longer in the place than they\\nimagined, or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the\\ntown. They looked down the steep streets, and seemed to see a\\nslight mist coming up from the sea.\\n\\n\"It is now or never,\" said Dr. Bull. \"I hear horses.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" corrected the Professor, \"a horse.\"\\n\\nAnd as they listened, it was evident that the noise, rapidly\\ncoming nearer on the rattling stones, was not the noise of the\\nwhole cavalcade but that of the one horseman, who had left it\\nfar behind--the insane Secretary.\\n\\nSyme\\'s family, like most of those who end in the simple life, had\\nonce owned a motor, and he knew all about them. He had leapt at\\nonce into the chauffeur\\'s seat, and with flushed face was wrenching\\nand tugging at the disused machinery. He bent his strength upon one\\nhandle, and then said quite quietly--\\n\\n\"I am afraid it\\'s no go.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, there swept round the corner a man rigid on his\\nrushing horse, with the rush and rigidity of an arrow. He had a\\nsmile that thrust out his chin as if it were dislocated. He swept\\nalongside of the stationary car, into which its company had\\ncrowded, and laid his hand on the front. It was the Secretary,\\nand his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph.\\n\\nSyme was leaning hard upon the steering wheel, and there was no\\nsound but the rumble of the other pursuers riding into the town.\\nThen there came quite suddenly a scream of scraping iron, and the\\ncar leapt forward. It plucked the Secretary clean out of his\\nsaddle, as a knife is whipped out of its sheath, trailed him\\nkicking terribly for twenty yards, and left him flung flat upon\\nthe road far in front of his frightened horse. As the car took\\nthe corner of the street with a splendid curve, they could just\\nsee the other anarchists filling the street and raising their\\nfallen leader.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t understand why it has grown so dark,\" said the Professor\\nat last in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Going to be a storm, I think,\" said Dr. Bull. \"I say, it\\'s a pity\\nwe haven\\'t got a light on this car, if only to see by.\"\\n\\n\"We have,\" said the Colonel, and from the floor of the car he\\nfished up a heavy, old-fashioned, carved iron lantern with a light\\ninside it. It was obviously an antique, and it would seem as if\\nits original use had been in some way semi-religious, for there\\nwas a rude moulding of a cross upon one of its sides.\\n\\n\"Where on earth did you get that?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"I got it where I got the car,\" answered the Colonel, chuckling,\\n\"from my best friend. While our friend here was fighting with the\\nsteering wheel, I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to\\nRenard, who was standing in his own porch, you will remember. \\'I\\nsuppose,\\' I said, \\'there\\'s no time to get a lamp.\\' He looked up,\\nblinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front\\nhall. From this was suspended, by chains of exquisite ironwork,\\nthis lantern, one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house.\\nBy sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling, shattering\\nthe painted panels, and bringing down two blue vases with his\\nviolence. Then he handed me the iron lantern, and I put it in the\\ncar. Was I not right when I said that Dr. Renard was worth\\nknowing?\"\\n\\n\"You were,\" said Syme seriously, and hung the heavy lantern over\\nthe front. There was a certain allegory of their whole position\\nin the contrast between the modern automobile and its strange\\necclesiastical lamp. Hitherto they had passed through the quietest\\npart of the town, meeting at most one or two pedestrians, who could\\ngive them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the place. Now,\\nhowever, the windows in the houses began one by one to be lit up,\\ngiving a greater sense of habitation and humanity. Dr. Bull turned\\nto the new detective who had led their flight, and permitted\\nhimself one of his natural and friendly smiles.\\n\\n\"These lights make one feel more cheerful.\"\\n\\nInspector Ratcliffe drew his brows together.\\n\\n\"There is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful,\" he\\nsaid, \"and they are those lights of the police station which I can\\nsee beyond the town. Please God we may be there in ten minutes.\"\\n\\nThen all Bull\\'s boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out\\nof him.\\n\\n\"Oh, this is all raving nonsense!\" he cried. \"If you really think\\nthat ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists, you must be\\nmadder than an anarchist yourself. If we turned and fought these\\nfellows, the whole town would fight for us.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the other with an immovable simplicity, \"the whole town\\nwould fight for them. We shall see.\\'\\n\\nWhile they were speaking the Professor had leant forward with\\nsudden excitement.\\n\\n\"What is that noise?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Oh, the horses behind us, I suppose,\" said the Colonel. \"I thought\\nwe had got clear of them.\"\\n\\n\"The horses behind us! No,\" said the Professor, \"it is not horses,\\nand it is not behind us.\"\\n\\nAlmost as he spoke, across the end of the street before them two\\nshining and rattling shapes shot past. They were gone almost in a\\nflash, but everyone could see that they were motor-cars, and the\\nProfessor stood up with a pale face and swore that they were the\\nother two motor-cars from Dr. Renard\\'s garage.\\n\\n\"I tell you they were his,\" he repeated, with wild eyes, \"and they\\nwere full of men in masks!\"\\n\\n\"Absurd!\" said the Colonel angrily. \"Dr. Renard would never give\\nthem his cars.\"\\n\\n\"He may have been forced,\" said Ratcliffe quietly. \"The whole town\\nis on their side.\"\\n\\n\"You still believe that,\" asked the Colonel incredulously.\\n\\n\"You will all believe it soon,\" said the other with a hopeless\\ncalm.\\n\\nThere was a puzzled pause for some little time, and then the\\nColonel began again abruptly--\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t believe it. The thing is nonsense. The plain people of\\na peaceable French town--\"\\n\\nHe was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light, which seemed close\\nto his eyes. As the car sped on it left a floating patch of white\\nsmoke behind it, and Syme had heard a shot shriek past his ear.\\n\\n\"My God!\" said the Colonel, \"someone has shot at us.\"\\n\\n\"It need not interrupt conversation,\" said the gloomy Ratcliffe.\\n\"Pray resume your remarks, Colonel. You were talking, I think,\\nabout the plain people of a peaceable French town.\"\\n\\nThe staring Colonel was long past minding satire. He rolled his\\neyes all round the street.\\n\\n\"It is extraordinary,\" he said, \"most extraordinary.\"\\n\\n\"A fastidious person,\" said Syme, \"might even call it unpleasant.\\nHowever, I suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street\\nare the Gendarmerie. We shall soon get there.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Inspector Ratcliffe, \"we shall never get there.\"\\n\\nHe had been standing up and looking keenly ahead of him. Now he sat\\ndown and smoothed his sleek hair with a weary gesture.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Bull sharply.\\n\\n\"I mean that we shall never get there,\" said the pessimist\\nplacidly. \"They have two rows of armed men across the road already;\\nI can see them from here. The town is in arms, as I said it was.\\n\\nI can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude.\"\\n\\nAnd Ratcliffe sat down comfortably in the car and lit a cigarette,\\nbut the others rose excitedly and stared down the road. Syme had\\nslowed down the car as their plans became doubtful, and he brought\\nit finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street\\nthat ran down very steeply to the sea.\\n\\nThe town was mostly in shadow, but the sun had not sunk; wherever\\nits level light could break through, it painted everything a\\nburning gold. Up this side street the last sunset light shone as\\nsharp and narrow as the shaft of artificial light at the theatre.\\nIt struck the car of the five friends, and lit it like a burning\\nchariot. But the rest of the street, especially the two ends of\\nit, was in the deepest twilight, and for some seconds they could\\nsee nothing. Then Syme, whose eyes were the keenest, broke into a\\nlittle bitter whistle, and said\\n\\n\"It is quite true. There is a crowd or an army or some such thing\\nacross the end of that street.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if there is,\" said Bull impatiently, \"it must be something\\nelse--a sham fight or the mayor\\'s birthday or something. I cannot\\nand will not believe that plain, jolly people in a place like this\\nwalk about with dynamite in their pockets. Get on a bit, Syme, and\\nlet us look at them.\"\\n\\nThe car crawled about a hundred yards farther, and then they were\\nall startled by Dr. Bull breaking into a high crow of laughter.\\n\\n\"Why, you silly mugs!\" he cried, \"what did I tell you. That\\ncrowd\\'s as law-abiding as a cow, and if it weren\\'t, it\\'s on our\\nside.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know?\" asked the professor, staring.\\n\\n\"You blind bat,\" cried Bull, \"don\\'t you see who is leading them?\"\\n\\nThey peered again, and then the Colonel, with a catch in his\\nvoice, cried out--\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s Renard!\"\\n\\nThere was, indeed, a rank of dim figures running across the road,\\nand they could not be clearly seen; but far enough in front to\\ncatch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down\\nthe unmistakable Dr. Renard, in a white hat, stroking his long\\nbrown beard, and holding a revolver in his left hand.\\n\\n\"What a fool I\\'ve been!\" exclaimed the Colonel. \"Of course, the\\ndear old boy has turned out to help us.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull was bubbling over with laughter, swinging the sword in\\nhis hand as carelessly as a cane. He jumped out of the car and\\nran across the intervening space, calling out--\\n\\n\"Dr. Renard! Dr. Renard!\"\\n\\nAn instant after Syme thought his own eyes had gone mad in his\\nhead. For the philanthropic Dr. Renard had deliberately raised his\\nrevolver and fired twice at Bull, so that the shots rang down the\\nroad.\\n\\nAlmost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from\\nthis atrocious explosion a long puff of white cloud went up also\\nfrom the cigarette of the cynical Ratcliffe. Like all the rest he\\nturned a little pale, but he smiled. Dr. Bull, at whom the bullets\\nhad been fired, just missing his scalp, stood quite still in the\\nmiddle of the road without a sign of fear, and then turned very\\nslowly and crawled back to the car, and climbed in with two holes\\nthrough his hat.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the cigarette smoker slowly, \"what do you think now?\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Dr. Bull with precision, \"that I am lying in bed\\nat No. 217 Peabody Buildings, and that I shall soon wake up with a\\njump; or, if that\\'s not it, I think that I am sitting in a small\\ncushioned cell in Hanwell, and that the doctor can\\'t make much of\\nmy case. But if you want to know what I don\\'t think, I\\'ll tell you.\\nI don\\'t think what you think. I don\\'t think, and I never shall\\nthink, that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern\\nthinkers. No, sir, I\\'m a democrat, and I still don\\'t believe that\\nSunday could convert one average navvy or counter-jumper. No, I may\\nbe mad, but humanity isn\\'t.\"\\n\\nSyme turned his bright blue eyes on Bull with an earnestness which\\nhe did not commonly make clear.\\n\\n\"You are a very fine fellow,\" he said. \"You can believe in a sanity\\nwhich is not merely your sanity. And you\\'re right enough about\\nhumanity, about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper.\\nBut you\\'re not right about Renard. I suspected him from the first.\\nHe\\'s rationalistic, and, what\\'s worse, he\\'s rich. When duty and\\nreligion are really destroyed, it will be by the rich.\"\\n\\n\"They are really destroyed now,\" said the man with a cigarette, and\\nrose with his hands in his pockets. \"The devils are coming on!\"\\n\\nThe men in the motor-car looked anxiously in the direction of his\\ndreamy gaze, and they saw that the whole regiment at the end of the\\nroad was advancing upon them, Dr. Renard marching furiously in\\nfront, his beard flying in the breeze.\\n\\nThe Colonel sprang out of the car with an intolerant exclamation.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"the thing is incredible. It must be a\\npractical joke. If you knew Renard as I do--it\\'s like calling Queen\\nVictoria a dynamiter. If you had got the man\\'s character into your\\nhead--\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull,\" said Syme sardonically, \"has at least got it into his\\nhat.\"\\n\\n\"I tell you it can\\'t be!\" cried the Colonel, stamping.\\n\\n\"Renard shall explain it. He shall explain it to me,\" and he strode\\nforward.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be in such a hurry,\" drawled the smoker. \"He will very soon\\nexplain it to all of us.\"\\n\\nBut the impatient Colonel was already out of earshot, advancing\\ntowards the advancing enemy. The excited Dr. Renard lifted his\\npistol again, but perceiving his opponent, hesitated, and the\\nColonel came face to face with him with frantic gestures of\\nremonstrance.\\n\\n\"It is no good,\" said Syme. \"He will never get anything out of that\\nold heathen. I vote we drive bang through the thick of them, bang\\nas the bullets went through Bull\\'s hat. We may all be killed, but\\nwe must kill a tidy number of them.\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t \\'ave it,\" said Dr. Bull, growing more vulgar in the\\nsincerity of his virtue. \"The poor chaps may be making a mistake.\\nGive the Colonel a chance.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we go back, then?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ratcliffe in a cold voice, \"the street behind us is held\\ntoo. In fact, I seem to see there another friend of yours, Syme.\"\\n\\nSyme spun round smartly, and stared backwards at the track which\\nthey had travelled. He saw an irregular body of horsemen gathering\\nand galloping towards them in the gloom. He saw above the foremost\\nsaddle the silver gleam of a sword, and then as it grew nearer the\\nsilver gleam of an old man\\'s hair. The next moment, with shattering\\nviolence, he had swung the motor round and sent it dashing down the\\nsteep side street to the sea, like a man that desired only to die.\\n\\n\"What the devil is up?\" cried the Professor, seizing his arm.\\n\\n\"The morning star has fallen!\" said Syme, as his own car went down\\nthe darkness like a falling star.\\n\\nThe others did not understand his words, but when they looked back\\nat the street above they saw the hostile cavalry coming round the\\ncorner and down the slopes after them; and foremost of all rode the\\ngood innkeeper, flushed with the fiery innocence of the evening\\nlight.\\n\\n\"The world is insane!\" said the Professor, and buried his face in\\nhis hands.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dr. Bull in adamantine humility, \"it is I.\"\\n\\n\"What are we going to do?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"At this moment,\" said Syme, with a scientific detachment, \"I think\\nwe are going to smash into a lamppost.\"\\n\\nThe next instant the automobile had come with a catastrophic jar\\nagainst an iron object. The instant after that four men had crawled\\nout from under a chaos of metal, and a tall lean lamp-post that had\\nstood up straight on the edge of the marine parade stood out, bent\\nand twisted, like the branch of a broken tree.\\n\\n\"Well, we smashed something,\" said the Professor, with a faint\\nsmile. \"That\\'s some comfort.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re becoming an anarchist,\" said Syme, dusting his clothes\\nwith his instinct of daintiness.\\n\\n\"Everyone is,\" said Ratcliffe.\\n\\nAs they spoke, the white-haired horseman and his followers came\\nthundering from above, and almost at the same moment a dark string\\nof men ran shouting along the sea-front. Syme snatched a sword,\\nand took it in his teeth; he stuck two others under his arm-pits,\\ntook a fourth in his left hand and the lantern in his right, and\\nleapt off the high parade on to the beach below.\\n\\nThe others leapt after him, with a common acceptance of such\\ndecisive action, leaving the debris and the gathering mob above\\nthem.\\n\\n\"We have one more chance,\" said Syme, taking the steel out of his\\nmouth. \"Whatever all this pandemonium means, I suppose the police\\nstation will help us. We can\\'t get there, for they hold the way.\\nBut there\\'s a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here,\\nwhich we could defend longer than anything else, like Horatius and\\nhis bridge. We must defend it till the Gendarmerie turn out. Keep\\nafter me.\"\\n\\nThey followed him as he went crunching down the beach, and in a\\nsecond or two their boots broke not on the sea gravel, but on\\nbroad, flat stones. They marched down a long, low jetty, running\\nout in one arm into the dim, boiling sea, and when they came to\\nthe end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their\\nstory. They turned and faced the town.\\n\\nThat town was transfigured with uproar. All along the high parade\\nfrom which they had just descended was a dark and roaring stream\\nof humanity, with tossing arms and fiery faces, groping and\\nglaring towards them. The long dark line was dotted with torches\\nand lanterns; but even where no flame lit up a furious face, they\\ncould see in the farthest figure, in the most shadowy gesture, an\\norganised hate. It was clear that they were the accursed of all\\nmen, and they knew not why.\\n\\nTwo or three men, looking little and black like monkeys, leapt\\nover the edge as they had done and dropped on to the beach. These\\ncame ploughing down the deep sand, shouting horribly, and strove\\nto wade into the sea at random. The example was followed, and the\\nwhole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edge like\\nblack treacle.\\n\\nForemost among the men on the beach Syme saw the peasant who had\\ndriven their cart. He splashed into the surf on a huge\\ncart-horse, and shook his axe at them.\\n\\n\"The peasant!\" cried Syme. \"They have not risen since the Middle\\nAges.\"\\n\\n\"Even if the police do come now,\" said the Professor mournfully,\\n\"they can do nothing with this mob.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsence!\" said Bull desperately; \"there must be some people\\nleft in the town who are human.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the hopeless Inspector, \"the human being will soon be\\nextinct. We are the last of mankind.\"\\n\\n\"It may be,\" said the Professor absently. Then he added in his\\ndreamy voice, \"What is all that at the end of the \\'Dunciad\\'?\\n\\n\\'Nor public flame; nor private, dares to shine;\\nNor human light is left, nor glimpse divine!\\nLo! thy dread Empire, Chaos, is restored;\\nLight dies before thine uncreating word:\\nThy hand, great Anarch, lets the curtain fall;\\nAnd universal darkness buries all.\"\\'\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried Bull suddenly, \"the gendarmes are out.\"\\n\\nThe low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and\\nbroken with hurrying figures, and they heard through the darkness\\nthe clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry.\\n\\n\"They are charging the mob!\" cried Bull in ecstacy or alarm.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme, \"they are formed along the parade.\"\\n\\n\"They have unslung their carbines,\" cried Bull dancing with\\nexcitement.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ratcliffe, \"and they are going to fire on us.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry, and bullets\\nseemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them.\\n\\n\"The gendarmes have joined them!\" cried the Professor, and struck\\nhis forehead.\\n\\n\"I am in the padded cell,\" said Bull solidly.\\n\\nThere was a long silence, and then Ratcliffe said, looking out\\nover the swollen sea, all a sort of grey purple--\\n\\n\"What does it matter who is mad or who is sane? We shall all be\\ndead soon.\"\\n\\nSyme turned to him and said--\\n\\n\"You are quite hopeless, then?\"\\n\\nMr. Ratcliffe kept a stony silence; then at last he said quietly--\\n\\n\"No; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless. There is one insane\\nlittle hope that I cannot get out of my mind. The power of this\\nwhole planet is against us, yet I cannot help wondering whether\\nthis one silly little hope is hopeless yet.\"\\n\\n\"In what or whom is your hope?\" asked Syme with curiosity.\\n\\n\"In a man I never saw,\" said the other, looking at the leaden sea.\\n\\n\"I know what you mean,\" said Syme in a low voice, \"the man in the\\ndark room. But Sunday must have killed him by now.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said the other steadily; \"but if so, he was the only\\nman whom Sunday found it hard to kill.\"\\n\\n\"I heard what you said,\" said the Professor, with his back turned.\\n\"I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw.\"\\n\\nAll of a sudden Syme, who was standing as if blind with\\nintrospective thought, swung round and cried out, like a man\\nwaking from sleep--\\n\\n\"Where is the Colonel? I thought he was with us!\"\\n\\n\"The Colonel! Yes,\" cried Bull, \"where on earth is the Colonel?\"\\n\\n\"He went to speak to Renard,\" said the Professor.\\n\\n\"We cannot leave him among all those beasts,\" cried Syme. \"Let us\\ndie like gentlemen if--\"\\n\\n\"Do not pity the Colonel,\" said Ratcliffe, with a pale sneer. \"He\\nis extremely comfortable. He is--\"\\n\\n\"No! no! no!\" cried Syme in a kind of frenzy, \"not the Colonel too!\\nI will never believe it!\"\\n\\n\"Will you believe your eyes?\" asked the other, and pointed to the\\nbeach.\\n\\nMany of their pursuers had waded into the water shaking their\\nfists, but the sea was rough, and they could not reach the pier.\\nTwo or three figures, however, stood on the beginning of the stone\\nfootway, and seemed to be cautiously advancing down it. The glare\\nof a chance lantern lit up the faces of the two foremost. One face\\nwore a black half-mask, and under it the mouth was twisting about\\nin such a madness of nerves that the black tuft of beard wriggled\\nround and round like a restless, living thing. The other was the\\nred face and white moustache of Colonel Ducroix. They were in\\nearnest consultation.\\n\\n\"Yes, he is gone too,\" said the Professor, and sat down on a\\nstone. \"Everything\\'s gone. I\\'m gone! I can\\'t trust my own bodily\\nmachinery. I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me.\"\\n\\n\"When my hand flies up,\" said Syme, \"it will strike somebody\\nelse,\" and he strode along the pier towards the Colonel, the\\nsword in one hand and the lantern in the other.\\n\\nAs if to destroy the last hope or doubt, the Colonel, who saw him\\ncoming, pointed his revolver at him and fired. The shot missed\\nSyme, but struck his sword, breaking it short at the hilt. Syme\\nrushed on, and swung the iron lantern above his head.\\n\\n\"Judas before Herod!\" he said, and struck the Colonel down upon\\nthe stones. Then he turned to the Secretary, whose frightful mouth\\nwas almost foaming now, and held the lamp high with so rigid and\\narresting a gesture, that the man was, as it were, frozen for a\\nmoment, and forced to hear.\\n\\n\"Do you see this lantern?\" cried Syme in a terrible voice. \"Do you\\nsee the cross carved on it, and the flame inside? You did not make\\nit. You did not light it, Better men than you, men who could\\nbelieve and obey, twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the\\nlegend of fire. There is not a street you walk on, there is not a\\nthread you wear, that was not made as this lantern was, by denying\\nyour philosophy of dirt and rats. You can make nothing. You can\\nonly destroy. You will destroy mankind; you will destroy the world.\\nLet that suffice you. Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall\\nnot destroy. It shall go where your empire of apes will never have\\nthe wit to find it.\"\\n\\nHe struck the Secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered;\\nand then, whirling it twice round his head, sent it flying far out\\nto sea, where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell.\\n\\n\"Swords!\" shouted Syme, turning his flaming face ; to the three\\nbehind him. \"Let us charge these dogs, for our time has come to\\ndie.\"\\n\\nHis three companions came after him sword in hand. Syme\\'s sword\\nwas broken, but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman,\\nflinging him down. In a moment they would have flung themselves\\nupon the face of the mob and perished, when an interruption came.\\nThe Secretary, ever since Syme\\'s speech, had stood with his hand\\nto his stricken head as if dazed; now he suddenly pulled off his\\nblack mask.\\n\\nThe pale face thus peeled in the lamplight revealed not so much\\nrage as astonishment. He put up his hand with an anxious authority.\\n\\n\"There is some mistake,\" he said. \"Mr. Syme, I hardly think you\\nunderstand your position. I arrest you in the name of the law.\"\\n\\n\"Of the law?\" said Syme, and dropped his stick.\\n\\n\"Certainly!\" said the Secretary. \"I am a detective from Scotland\\nYard,\" and he took a small blue card from his pocket.\\n\\n\"And what do you suppose we are?\" asked the Professor, and threw\\nup his arms.\\n\\n\"You,\" said the Secretary stiffly, \"are, as I know for a fact,\\nmembers of the Supreme Anarchist Council. Disguised as one of\\nyou, I--\"\\n\\nDr. Bull tossed his sword into the sea.\\n\\n\"There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council,\" he said. \"We were\\nall a lot of silly policemen looking at each other. And all these\\nnice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were\\nthe dynamiters. I knew I couldn\\'t be wrong about the mob,\" he said,\\nbeaming over the enormous multitude, which stretched away to the\\ndistance on both sides. \"Vulgar people are never mad. I\\'m vulgar\\nmyself, and I know. I am now going on shore to stand a drink to\\neverybody here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nTHE PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENT\\n\\nNEXT morning five bewildered but hilarious people took the boat for\\nDover. The poor old Colonel might have had some cause to complain,\\nhaving been first forced to fight for two factions that didn\\'t\\nexist, and then knocked down with an iron lantern. But he was a\\nmagnanimous old gentleman, and being much relieved that neither\\nparty had anything to do with dynamite, he saw them off on the pier\\nwith great geniality.\\n\\nThe five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to\\neach other. The Secretary had to tell Syme how they had come to\\nwear masks originally in order to approach the supposed enemy as\\nfellow-conspirators;\\n\\nSyme had to explain how they had fled with such swiftness through\\na civilised country. But above all these matters of detail which\\ncould be explained, rose the central mountain of the matter that\\nthey could not explain. What did it all mean? If they were all\\nharmless officers, what was Sunday? If he had not seized the world,\\nwhat on earth had he been up to? Inspector Ratcliffe was still\\ngloomy about this.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t make head or tail of old Sunday\\'s little game any more\\nthan you can,\" he said. \"But whatever else Sunday is, he isn\\'t\\na blameless citizen. Damn it! do you remember his face?\"\\n\\n\"I grant you,\" answered Syme, \"that I have never been able to\\nforget it.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the Secretary, \"I suppose we can find out soon, for\\ntomorrow we have our next general meeting. You will excuse me,\"\\nhe said, with a rather ghastly smile, \"for being well acquainted\\nwith my secretarial duties.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose you are right,\" said the Professor reflectively. \"I\\nsuppose we might find it out from him; but I confess that I should\\nfeel a bit afraid of asking Sunday who he really is.\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" asked the Secretary, \"for fear of bombs?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Professor, \"for fear he might tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Let us have some drinks,\" said Dr. Bull, after a silence.\\n\\nThroughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highly\\nconvivial, but they instinctively kept together. Dr. Bull, who had\\nalways been the optimist of the party, endeavoured to persuade the\\nother four that the whole company could take the same hansom cab\\nfrom Victoria; but this was over-ruled, and they went in a\\nfour-wheeler, with Dr. Bull on the box, singing. They finished\\ntheir journey at an hotel in Piccadilly Circus, so as to be close\\nto the early breakfast next morning in Leicester Square. Yet even\\nthen the adventures of the day were not entirely over. Dr. Bull,\\ndiscontented with the general proposal to go to bed, had strolled\\nout of the hotel at about eleven to see and taste some of the\\nbeauties of London. Twenty minutes afterwards, however, he came\\nback and made quite a clamour in the hall. Syme, who tried at\\nfirst to soothe him, was forced at last to listen to his\\ncommunication with quite new attention.\\n\\n\"I tell you I\\'ve seen him!\" said Dr. Bull, with thick emphasis.\\n\\n\"Whom?\" asked Syme quickly. \"Not the President?\"\\n\\n\"Not so bad as that,\" said Dr. Bull, with unnecessary laughter,\\n\"not so bad as that. I\\'ve got him here.\"\\n\\n\"Got whom here?\" asked Syme impatiently.\\n\\n\"Hairy man,\" said the other lucidly, \"man that used to be hairy\\nman--Gogol. Here he is,\" and he pulled forward by a reluctant\\nelbow the identical young man who five days before had marched\\nout of the Council with thin red hair and a pale face, the first\\nof all the sham anarchists who had been exposed.\\n\\n\"Why do you worry with me?\" he cried. \"You have expelled me as a\\nspy.\"\\n\\n\"We are all spies!\" whispered Syme.\\n\\n\"We\\'re all spies!\" shouted Dr. Bull. \"Come and have a drink.\"\\n\\nNext morning the battalion of the reunited six marched stolidly\\ntowards the hotel in Leicester Square.\\n\\n\"This is more cheerful,\" said Dr. Bull; \"we are six men going to\\nask one man what he means.\"\\n\\n\"I think it is a bit queerer than that,\" said Syme. \"I think it\\nis six men going to ask one man what they mean.\"\\n\\nThey turned in silence into the Square, and though the hotel was\\nin the opposite corner, they saw at once the little balcony and a\\nfigure that looked too big for it. He was sitting alone with bent\\nhead, poring over a newspaper. But all his councillors, who had\\ncome to vote him down, crossed that Square as if they were watched\\nout of heaven by a hundred eyes.\\n\\nThey had disputed much upon their policy, about whether they\\nshould leave the unmasked Gogol without and begin diplomatically,\\nor whether they should bring him in and blow up the gunpowder at\\nonce. The influence of Syme and Bull prevailed for the latter\\ncourse, though the Secretary to the last asked them why they\\nattacked Sunday so rashly.\\n\\n\"My reason is quite simple,\" said Syme. \"I attack him rashly\\nbecause I am afraid of him.\"\\n\\nThey followed Syme up the dark stair in silence, and they all came\\nout simultaneously into the broad sunlight of the morning and the\\nbroad sunlight of Sunday\\'s smile.\\n\\n\"Delightful!\" he said. \"So pleased to see you all. What an\\nexquisite day it is. Is the Czar dead?\"\\n\\nThe Secretary, who happened to be foremost, drew himself together\\nfor a dignified outburst.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" he said sternly \"there has been no massacre. I bring you\\nnews of no such disgusting spectacles.\"\\n\\n\"Disgusting spectacles?\" repeated the President, with a bright,\\ninquiring smile. \"You mean Dr. Bull\\'s spectacles?\"\\n\\nThe Secretary choked for a moment, and the President went on with\\na sort of smooth appeal--\\n\\n\"Of course, we all have our opinions and even our eyes, but really\\nto call them disgusting before the man himself--\"\\n\\nDr. Bull tore off his spectacles and broke them on the table.\\n\\n\"My spectacles are blackguardly,\" he said, \"but I\\'m not. Look at\\nmy face.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say it\\'s the sort of face that grows on one,\" said the\\nPresident, \"in fact, it grows on you; and who am I to quarrel\\nwith the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life? I dare say it will\\ngrow on me some day.\"\\n\\n\"We have no time for tomfoolery,\" said the Secretary, breaking in\\nsavagely. \"We have come to know what all this means. Who are you?\\nWhat are you? Why did you get us all here? Do you know who and\\nwhat we are? Are you a half-witted man playing the conspirator,\\nor are you a clever man playing the fool? Answer me, I tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Candidates,\" murmured Sunday, \"are only required to answer eight\\nout of the seventeen questions on the paper. As far as I can make\\nout, you want me to tell you what I am, and what you are, and what\\nthis table is, and what this Council is, and what this world is\\nfor all I know. Well, I will go so far as to rend the veil of one\\nmystery. If you want to know what you are, you are a set of\\nhighly well-intentioned young jackasses.\"\\n\\n\"And you,\" said Syme, leaning forward, \"what are you?\"\\n\\n\"I? What am I?\" roared the President, and he rose slowly to an\\nincredible height, like some enormous wave about to arch above\\nthem and break. \"You want to know what I am, do you? Bull, you\\nare a man of science. Grub in the roots of those trees and find\\nout the truth about them. Syme, you are a poet. Stare at those\\nmorning clouds. But I tell you this, that you will have found\\nout the truth of the last tree and the top-most cloud before the\\ntruth about me. You will understand the sea, and I shall be still\\na riddle; you shall know what the stars are, and not know what I\\nam. Since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like\\na wolf--kings and sages, and poets and lawgivers, all the\\nchurches, and all the philosophies. But I have never been caught\\nyet, and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay. I have\\ngiven them a good run for their money, and I will now.\"\\n\\nBefore one of them could move, the monstrous man had swung himself\\nlike some huge ourang-outang over the balustrade of the balcony.\\nYet before he dropped he pulled himself up again as on a horizontal\\nbar, and thrusting his great chin over the edge of the balcony,\\nsaid solemnly--\\n\\n\"There\\'s one thing I\\'ll tell you though about who I am. I am the\\nman in the dark room, who made you all policemen.\"\\n\\nWith that he fell from the balcony, bouncing on the stones below\\nlike a great ball of india-rubber, and went bounding off towards\\nthe corner of the Alhambra, where he hailed a hansom-cab and sprang\\ninside it. The six detectives had been standing thunderstruck and\\nlivid in the light of his last assertion; but when he disappeared\\ninto the cab, Syme\\'s practical senses returned to him, and leaping\\nover the balcony so recklessly as almost to break his legs, he\\ncalled another cab.\\n\\nHe and Bull sprang into the cab together, the Professor and the\\nInspector into another, while the Secretary and the late Gogol\\nscrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying Syme, who\\nwas pursuing the flying President. Sunday led them a wild chase\\ntowards the north-west, his cabman, evidently under the influence\\nof more than common inducements, urging the horse at breakneck\\nspeed. But Syme was in no mood for delicacies, and he stood up in\\nhis own cab shouting, \"Stop thief!\" until crowds ran along beside\\nhis cab, and policemen began to stop and ask questions. All this\\nhad its influence upon the President\\'s cabman, who began to look\\ndubious, and to slow down to a trot. He opened the trap to talk\\nreasonably to his fare, and in so doing let the long whip droop\\nover the front of the cab. Sunday leant forward, seized it, and\\njerked it violently out of the man\\'s hand. Then standing up in\\nfront of the cab himself, he lashed the horse and roared aloud,\\nso that they went down the streets like a flying storm. Through\\nstreet after street and square after square went whirling this\\npreposterous vehicle, in which the fare was urging the horse and\\nthe driver trying desperately to stop it. The other three cabs\\ncame after it (if the phrase be permissible of a cab) like panting\\nhounds. Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows.\\n\\nAt the highest ecstacy of speed, Sunday turned round on the\\nsplashboard where he stood, and sticking his great grinning head\\nout of the cab, with white hair whistling in the wind, he made a\\nhorrible face at his pursuers, like some colossal urchin. Then\\nraising his right hand swiftly, he flung a ball of paper in Syme\\'s\\nface and vanished. Syme caught the thing while instinctively\\nwarding it off, and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled\\npapers. One was addressed to himself, and the other to Dr. Bull,\\nwith a very long, and it is to be feared partly ironical, string\\nof letters after his name. Dr. Bull\\'s address was, at any rate,\\nconsiderably longer than his communication, for the communication\\nconsisted entirely of the words:--\\n\\n\"What about Martin Tupper now?\"\\n\\n\"What does the old maniac mean?\" asked Bull, staring at the words.\\n\"What does yours say, Syme?\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s message was, at any rate, longer, and ran as follows:--\\n\\n\"No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by\\nthe Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that. But,\\nfor the last time, where are your goloshes? The thing is too bad,\\nespecially after what uncle said.\"\\n\\nThe President\\'s cabman seemed to be regaining some control over\\nhis horse, and the pursuers gained a little as they swept round\\ninto the Edgware Road. And here there occurred what seemed to the\\nallies a providential stoppage. Traffic of every kind was swerving\\nto right or left or stopping, for down the long road was coming\\nthe unmistakable roar announcing the fire-engine, which in a few\\nseconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt. But quick as it went\\nby, Sunday had bounded out of his cab, sprung at the fire-engine,\\ncaught it, slung himself on to it, and was seen as he disappeared\\nin the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with\\nexplanatory gestures.\\n\\n\"After him!\" howled Syme. \"He can\\'t go astray now. There\\'s no\\nmistaking a fire-engine.\"\\n\\nThe three cabmen, who had been stunned for a moment, whipped\\nup their horses and slightly decreased the distance between\\nthemselves and their disappearing prey. The President\\nacknowledged this proximity by coming to the back of the car,\\nbowing repeatedly, kissing his hand, and finally flinging a\\nneatly-folded note into the bosom of Inspector Ratcliffe. When\\nthat gentleman opened it, not without impatience, he found it\\ncontained the words:--\\n\\n\"Fly at once. The truth about your trouser-stretchers is known.\\n--A FRIEND.\"\\n\\nThe fire-engine had struck still farther to the north, into a\\nregion that they did not recognise; and as it ran by a line of high\\nrailings shadowed with trees, the six friends were startled, but\\nsomewhat relieved, to see the President leap from the fire-engine,\\nthough whether through another whim or the increasing protest of\\nhis entertainers they could not see. Before the three cabs,\\nhowever, could reach up to the spot, he had gone up the high\\nrailings like a huge grey cat, tossed himself over, and vanished\\nin a darkness of leaves.\\n\\nSyme with a furious gesture stopped his cab, jumped out, and\\nsprang also to the escalade. When he had one leg over the fence\\nand his friends were following, he turned a face on them which\\nshone quite pale in the shadow.\\n\\n\"What place can this be?\" he asked. \"Can it be the old devil\\'s\\nhouse? I\\'ve heard he has a house in North London.\"\\n\\n\"All the better,\" said the Secretary grimly, planting a foot in\\na foothold, \"we shall find him at home.\"\\n\\n\"No, but it isn\\'t that,\" said Syme, knitting his brows. \"I hear\\nthe most horrible noises, like devils laughing and sneezing and\\nblowing their devilish noses!\"\\n\\n\"His dogs barking, of course,\" said the Secretary.\\n\\n\"Why not say his black-beetles barking!\" said Syme furiously,\\n\"snails barking! geraniums barking! Did you ever hear a dog bark\\nlike that?\"\\n\\nHe held up his hand, and there came out of the thicket a long\\ngrowling roar that seemed to get under the skin and freeze the\\nflesh--a low thrilling roar that made a throbbing in the air\\nall about them.\\n\\n\"The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs,\" said Gogol, and\\nshuddered.\\n\\nSyme had jumped down on the other side, but he still stood\\nlistening impatiently.\\n\\n\"Well, listen to that,\" he said, \"is that a dog--anybody\\'s dog?\"\\n\\nThere broke upon their ear a hoarse screaming as of things\\nprotesting and clamouring in sudden pain; and then, far off\\nlike an echo, what sounded like a long nasal trumpet.\\n\\n\"Well, his house ought to be hell!\" said the Secretary; \"and if\\nit is hell, I\\'m going in!\" and he sprang over the tall railings\\nalmost with one swing.\\n\\nThe others followed. They broke through a tangle of plants and\\nshrubs, and came out on an open path. Nothing was in sight, but\\nDr. Bull suddenly struck his hands together.\\n\\n\"Why, you asses,\" he cried, \"it\\'s the Zoo!\"\\n\\nAs they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild\\nquarry, a keeper in uniform came running along the path with a\\nman in plain clothes.\\n\\n\"Has it come this way?\" gasped the keeper.\\n\\n\"Has what?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"The elephant!\" cried the keeper. \"An elephant has gone mad and\\nrun away!\"\\n\\n\"He has run away with an old gentleman,\" said the other stranger\\nbreathlessly, \"a poor old gentleman with white hair! \"\\n\\n\"What sort of old gentleman?\" asked Syme, with great curiosity.\\n\\n\"A very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes,\" said\\nthe keeper eagerly.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme, \"if he\\'s that particular kind of old gentleman,\\nif you\\'re quite sure that he\\'s a large and fat old gentleman in\\ngrey clothes, you may take my word for it that the elephant has\\nnot run away with him. He has run away with the elephant. The\\nelephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he\\ndid not consent to the elopement. And, by thunder, there he is!\"\\n\\nThere was no doubt about it this time. Clean across the space of\\ngrass, about two hundred yards away, with a crowd screaming and\\nscampering vainly at his heels, went a huge grey elephant at an\\nawful stride, with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship\\'s\\nbowsprit, and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom. On the back of\\nthe bellowing and plunging animal sat President Sunday with all\\nthe placidity of a sultan, but goading the animal to a furious\\nspeed with some sharp object in his hand.\\n\\n\"Stop him!\" screamed the populace. \"He\\'ll be out of the gate!\"\\n\\n\"Stop a landslide!\" said the keeper. \"He is out of the gate!\"\\n\\nAnd even as he spoke, a final crash and roar of terror announced\\nthat the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the\\nZoological Gardens, and was careening down Albany Street like a\\nnew and swift sort of omnibus.\\n\\n\"Great Lord!\" cried Bull, \"I never knew an elephant could go so\\nfast. Well, it must be hansom-cabs again if we are to keep him in\\nsight.\"\\n\\nAs they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had\\nvanished, Syme felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in\\nthe cages which they passed. Afterwards he thought it queer that\\nhe should have seen them so clearly. He remembered especially\\nseeing pelicans, with their preposterous, pendant throats. He\\nwondered why the pelican was the symbol of charity, except it was\\nthat it wanted a good deal of charity to admire a pelican. He\\nremembered a hornbill, which was simply a huge yellow beak with a\\nsmall bird tied on behind it. The whole gave him a sensation, the\\nvividness of which he could not explain, that Nature was always\\nmaking quite mysterious jokes. Sunday had told them that they\\nwould understand him when they had understood the stars. He\\nwondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill.\\n\\nThe six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed\\nthe elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long\\nstretch of the streets. This time Sunday did not turn round, but\\noffered them the solid stretch of his unconscious back, which\\nmaddened them, if possible, more than his previous mockeries. Just\\nbefore they came to Baker Street, however, he was seen to throw\\nsomething far up into the air, as a boy does a ball meaning to\\ncatch it again. But at their rate of racing it fell far behind,\\njust by the cab containing Gogol; and in faint hope of a clue or\\nfor some impulse unexplainable, he stopped his cab so as to pick it\\nup. It was addressed to himself, and was quite a bulky parcel. On\\nexamination, however, its bulk was found to consist of thirty-three\\npieces of paper of no value wrapped one round the other. When the\\nlast covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small slip of\\npaper, on which was written:--\\n\\n\"The word, I fancy, should be \\'pink\\'.\"\\n\\nThe man once known as Gogol said nothing, but the movements of his\\nhands and feet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed\\nefforts.\\n\\nThrough street after street, through district after district, went\\nthe prodigy of the flying elephant, calling crowds to every window,\\nand driving the traffic left and right. And still through all this\\ninsane publicity the three cabs toiled after it, until they came to\\nbe regarded as part of a procession, and perhaps the advertisement\\nof a circus. They went at such a rate that distances were shortened\\nbeyond belief, and Syme saw the Albert Hall in Kensington when he\\nthought that he was still in Paddington. The animal\\'s pace was even\\nmore fast and free through the empty, aristocratic streets of South\\nKensington, and he finally headed towards that part of the sky-line\\nwhere the enormous Wheel of Earl\\'s Court stood up in the sky. The\\nwheel grew larger and larger, till it filled heaven like the wheel\\nof stars.\\n\\nThe beast outstripped the cabs. They lost him round several\\ncorners, and when they came to one of the gates of the Earl\\'s Court\\nExhibition they found themselves finally blocked. In front of them\\nwas an enormous crowd; in the midst of it was an enormous elephant,\\nheaving and shuddering as such shapeless creatures do. But the\\nPresident had disappeared.\\n\\n\"Where has he gone to?\" asked Syme, slipping to the ground.\\n\\n\"Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition, sir!\" said an official in a\\ndazed manner. Then he added in an injured voice: \"Funny gentleman,\\nsir. Asked me to hold his horse, and gave me this.\"\\n\\nHe held out with distaste a piece of folded paper, addressed: \"To\\nthe Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council.\"\\n\\nThe Secretary, raging, rent it open, and found written inside it:--\\n\\n\"When the herring runs a mile,\\nLet the Secretary smile;\\nWhen the herring tries to fly,\\nLet the Secretary die.\\n                Rustic Proverb.\"\\n\\n\"Why the eternal crikey,\" began the Secretary, \"did you let the\\nman in? Do people commonly come to you Exhibition riding on mad\\nelephants? Do--\"\\n\\n\"Look!\" shouted Syme suddenly. \"Look over there!\"\\n\\n\"Look at what?\" asked the Secretary savagely.\\n\\n\"Look at the captive balloon!\" said Syme, and pointed in a frenzy.\\n\\n\"Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon?\\' demanded the\\nSecretary. \"What is there queer about a captive balloon?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said Syme, \"except that it isn\\'t captive!\\'\\n\\nThey all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled\\nabove the Exhibition on a string, like a child\\'s balloon. A second\\nafterwards the string came in two just under the car, and the\\nballoon, broken loose, floated away with the freedom of a soap\\nbubble.\\n\\n\"Ten thousand devils!\" shrieked the Secretary. \"He\\'s got into it!\"\\nand he shook his fists at the sky.\\n\\nThe balloon, borne by some chance wind, came right above them, and\\nthey could see the great white head of the President peering over\\nthe side and looking benevolently down on them.\\n\\n\"God bless my soul!\" said the Professor with the elderly manner\\nthat he could never disconnect from his bleached beard and\\nparchment face. \"God bless my soul! I seemed to fancy that\\nsomething fell on the top of my hat!\"\\n\\nHe put up a trembling hand and took from that shelf a piece of\\ntwisted paper, which he opened absently only to find it inscribed\\nwith a true lover\\'s knot and, the words:--\\n\\n\"Your beauty has not left me indifferent.--From LITTLE SNOWDROP. \"\\n\\nThere was a short silence, and then Syme said, biting his beard--\\n\\n\"I\\'m not beaten yet. The blasted thing must come down somewhere.\\nLet\\'s follow it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nTHE SIX PHILOSOPHERS\\n\\nACROSS green fields, and breaking through blooming hedges, toiled\\nsix draggled detectives, about five miles out of London. The\\noptimist of the party had at first proposed that they should\\nfollow the balloon across South England in hansom-cabs. But he\\nwas ultimately convinced of the persistent refusal of the balloon\\nto follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the\\ncabmen to follow the balloon. Consequently the tireless though\\nexasperated travellers broke through black thickets and ploughed\\nthrough ploughed fields till each was turned into a figure too\\noutrageous to be mistaken for a tramp. Those green hills of\\nSurrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the admirable light\\ngrey suit in which Syme had set out from Saffron Park. His silk\\nhat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough, his coat-tails\\nwere torn to the shoulder by arresting thorns, the clay of\\nEngland was splashed up to his collar; but he still carried his\\nyellow beard forward with a silent and furious determination, and\\nhis eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of gas, which in\\nthe full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud.\\n\\n\"After all,\" he said, \"it is very beautiful!\"\\n\\n\"It is singularly and strangely beautiful!\" said the Professor. \"I\\nwish the beastly gas-bag would burst!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dr. Bull, \"I hope it won\\'t. It might hurt the old boy.\"\\n\\n\"Hurt him!\" said the vindictive Professor, \"hurt him! Not as much\\nas I\\'d hurt him if I could get up with him. Little Snowdrop!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want him hurt, somehow,\" said Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"What!\" cried the Secretary bitterly. \"Do you believe all that tale\\nabout his being our man in the dark room? Sunday would say he was\\nanybody.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know whether I believe it or not,\" said Dr. Bull. \"But it\\nisn\\'t that that I mean. I can\\'t wish old Sunday\\'s balloon to burst\\nbecause--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme impatiently, \"because?\"\\n\\n\"Well, because he\\'s so jolly like a balloon himself,\" said Dr. Bull\\ndesperately. \"I don\\'t understand a word of all that idea of his\\nbeing the same man who gave us all our blue cards. It seems to make\\neverything nonsense. But I don\\'t care who knows it, I always had a\\nsympathy for old Sunday himself, wicked as he was. Just as if he\\nwas a great bouncing baby. How can I explain what my queer sympathy\\nwas? It didn\\'t prevent my fighting him like hell! Shall I make it\\nclear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat?\"\\n\\n\"You will not,\" said the Secretary.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got it now,\" cried Bull, \"it was because he was so fat and so\\nlight. Just like a balloon. We always think of fat people as heavy,\\nbut he could have danced against a sylph. I see now what I mean.\\nModerate strength is shown in violence, supreme strength is shown\\nin levity. It was like the old speculations--what would happen if\\nan elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper?\"\\n\\n\"Our elephant,\" said Syme, looking upwards, \"has leapt into the\\nsky like a grasshopper.\"\\n\\n\"And somehow,\" concluded Bull, \"that\\'s why I can\\'t help liking old\\nSunday. No, it\\'s not an admiration of force, or any silly thing\\nlike that. There is a kind of gaiety in the thing, as if he were\\nbursting with some good news. Haven\\'t you sometimes felt it on a\\nspring day? You know Nature plays tricks, but somehow that day\\nproves they are good-natured tricks. I never read the Bible myself,\\nbut that part they laugh at is literal truth, \\'Why leap ye, ye high\\nhills?\\' The hills do leap--at least, they try to. . . . Why do I\\nlike Sunday? . . . how can I tell you? . . . because he\\'s such a\\nBounder.\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence, and then the Secretary said in a curious,\\nstrained voice--\\n\\n\"You do not know Sunday at all. Perhaps it is because you are\\nbetter than I, and do not know hell. I was a fierce fellow, and a\\ntrifle morbid from the first. The man who sits in darkness, and\\nwho chose us all, chose me because I had all the crazy look of a\\nconspirator--because my smile went crooked, and my eyes were\\ngloomy, even when I smiled. But there must have been something in\\nme that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men. For when\\nI first saw Sunday he expressed to me, not your airy vitality, but\\nsomething both gross and sad in the Nature of Things. I found him\\nsmoking in a twilight room, a room with brown blind down,\\ninfinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our\\nmaster lives. He sat there on a bench, a huge heap of a man, dark\\nand out of shape. He listened to all my words without speaking or\\neven stirring. I poured out my most passionate appeals, and asked\\nmy most eloquent questions. Then, after a long silence, the Thing\\nbegan to shake, and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady.\\nIt shook like a loathsome and living jelly. It reminded me of\\neverything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the\\norigin of life--the deep sea lumps and protoplasm. It seemed like\\nthe final form of matter, the most shapeless and the most shameful.\\nI could only tell myself, from its shudderings, that it was\\nsomething at least that such a monster could be miserable. And\\nthen it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with\\na lonely laughter, and the laughter was at me. Do you ask me to\\nforgive him that? It is no small thing to be laughed at by\\nsomething at once lower and stronger than oneself.\"\\n\\n\"Surely you fellows are exaggerating wildly,\" cut in the clear\\nvoice of Inspector Ratcliffe. \"President Sunday is a terrible\\nfellow for one\\'s intellect, but he is not such a Barnum\\'s freak\\nphysically as you make out. He received me in an ordinary office,\\nin a grey check coat, in broad daylight. He talked to me in an\\nordinary way. But I\\'ll tell you what is a trifle creepy about\\nSunday. His room is neat, his clothes are neat, everything seems\\nin order; but he\\'s absent-minded. Sometimes his great bright eyes\\ngo quite blind. For hours he forgets that you are there. Now\\nabsent-mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man. We think\\nof a wicked man as vigilant. We can\\'t think of a wicked man who is\\nhonestly and sincerely dreamy, because we daren\\'t think of a wicked\\nman alone with himself. An absentminded man means a good-natured\\nman. It means a man who, if he happens to see you, will apologise.\\nBut how will you bear an absentminded man who, if he happens to see\\nyou, will kill you? That is what tries the nerves, abstraction\\ncombined with cruelty. Men have felt it sometimes when they went\\nthrough wild forests, and felt that the animals there were at once\\ninnocent and pitiless. They might ignore or slay. How would you\\nlike to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent-minded\\ntiger?\"\\n\\n\"And what do you think of Sunday, Gogol?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think of Sunday on principle,\" said Gogol simply, \"any\\nmore than I stare at the sun at noonday.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that is a point of view,\" said Syme thoughtfully. \"What do\\nyou say, Professor?\"\\n\\nThe Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick, and\\nhe did not answer at all.\\n\\n\"Wake up, Professor!\" said Syme genially. \"Tell us what you think\\nof Sunday.\"\\n\\nThe Professor spoke at last very slowly.\\n\\n\"I think something,\" he said, \"that I cannot say clearly. Or,\\nrather, I think something that I cannot even think clearly. But\\nit is something like this. My early life, as you know, was a bit\\ntoo large and loose.\\n\\nWell, when I saw Sunday\\'s face I thought it was too large--\\neverybody does, but I also thought it was too loose. The face\\nwas so big, that one couldn\\'t focus it or make it a face at all.\\nThe eye was so far away from the nose, that it wasn\\'t an eye.\\nThe mouth was so much by itself, that one had to think of it by\\nitself. The whole thing is too hard to explain.\"\\n\\nHe paused for a little, still trailing his stick, and then went\\non--\\n\\n\"But put it this way. Walking up a road at night, I have seen a\\nlamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete\\nand unmistakable face. If anyone in heaven has that face I shall\\nknow him again. Yet when I walked a little farther I found that\\nthere was no face, that the window was ten yards away, the lamp ten\\nhundred yards, the cloud beyond the world. Well, Sunday\\'s face\\nescaped me; it ran away to right and left, as such chance pictures\\nrun away. And so his face has made me, somehow, doubt whether there\\nare any faces. I don\\'t know whether your face, Bull, is a face or a\\ncombination in perspective. Perhaps one black disc of your beastly\\nglasses is quite close and another fifty miles away. Oh, the doubts\\nof a materialist are not worth a dump. Sunday has taught me the\\nlast and the worst doubts, the doubts of a spiritualist. I am a\\nBuddhist, I suppose; and Buddhism is not a creed, it is a doubt. My\\npoor dear Bull, I do not believe that you really have a face. I\\nhave not faith enough to believe in matter.\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb, which, reddened\\nin the evening light, looked like some rosier and more innocent\\nworld.\\n\\n\"Have you noticed an odd thing,\" he said, \"about all your\\ndescriptions? Each man of you finds Sunday quite different, yet\\neach man of you can only find one thing to compare him to--the\\nuniverse itself. Bull finds him like the earth in spring, Gogol\\nlike the sun at noonday. The Secretary is reminded of the shapeless\\nprotoplasm, and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin\\nforests. The Professor says he is like a changing landscape. This\\nis queer, but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd\\nnotion about the President, and I also find that I think of Sunday\\nas I think of the whole world.\"\\n\\n\"Get on a little faster, Syme,\" said Bull; \"never mind the\\nballoon.\"\\n\\n\"When I first saw Sunday,\" said Syme slowly, \"I only saw his back;\\nand when I saw his back, I knew he was the worst man in the world.\\nHis neck and shoulders were brutal, like those of some apish god.\\nHis head had a stoop that was hardly human, like the stoop of an\\nox. In fact, I had at once the revolting fancy that this was not\\na man at all, but a beast dressed up in men\\'s clothes.\"\\n\\n\"Get on,\" said Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"And then the queer thing happened. I had seen his back from the\\nstreet, as he sat in the balcony. Then I entered the hotel, and\\ncoming round the other side of him, saw his face in the sunlight.\\nHis face frightened me, as it did everyone; but not because it was\\nbrutal, not because it was evil. On the contrary, it frightened me\\nbecause it was so beautiful, because it was so good.\"\\n\\n\"Syme,\" exclaimed the Secretary, \"are you ill?\"\\n\\n\"It was like the face of some ancient archangel, judging justly\\nafter heroic wars. There was laughter in the eyes, and in the mouth\\nhonour and sorrow. There was the same white hair, the same great,\\ngrey-clad shoulders that I had seen from behind. But when I saw him\\nfrom behind I was certain he was an animal, and when I saw him in\\nfront I knew he was a god.\"\\n\\n\"Pan,\" said the Professor dreamily, \"was a god and an animal.\"\\n\\n\"Then, and again and always,\" went on Syme like a man talking to\\nhimself, \"that has been for me the mystery of Sunday, and it is\\nalso the mystery of the world. When I see the horrible back, I am\\nsure the noble face is but a mask. When I see the face but for an\\ninstant, I know the back is only a jest. Bad is so bad, that we\\ncannot but think good an accident; good is so good, that we feel\\ncertain that evil could be explained. But the whole came to a kind\\nof crest yesterday when I raced Sunday for the cab, and was just\\nbehind him all the way.\"\\n\\n\"Had you time for thinking then?\" asked Ratcliffe.\\n\\n\"Time,\" replied Syme, \"for one outrageous thought. I was suddenly\\npossessed with the idea that the blind, blank back of his head\\nreally was his face--an awful, eyeless face staring at me! And I\\nfancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure\\nrunning backwards, and dancing as he ran.\"\\n\\n\"Horrible!\" said Dr. Bull, and shuddered.\\n\\n\"Horrible is not the word,\" said Syme. \"It was exactly the worst\\ninstant of my life. And yet ten minutes afterwards, when he put his\\nhead out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle, I knew that\\nhe was only like a father playing hide-and-seek with his children.\"\\n\\n\"It is a long game,\" said the Secretary, and frowned at his broken\\nboots.\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis. \"Shall I\\ntell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only\\nknown the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it\\nlooks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is\\nnot a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that\\neverything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get\\nround in front--\"\\n\\n\"Look!\" cried out Bull clamorously, \"the balloon is coming down!\"\\n\\nThere was no need to cry out to Syme, who had never taken his eyes\\noff it. He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the\\nsky, right itself, and then sink slowly behind the trees like a\\nsetting sun.\\n\\nThe man called Gogol, who had hardly spoken through all their weary\\ntravels, suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit.\\n\\n\"He is dead!\" he cried. \"And now I know he was my friend--my friend\\nin the dark!\"\\n\\n\"Dead!\" snorted the Secretary. \"You will not find him dead easily.\\nIf he has been tipped out of the car, we shall find him rolling as\\na colt rolls in a field, kicking his legs for fun.\"\\n\\n\"Clashing his hoofs,\" said the Professor. \"The colts do, and so did\\nPan.\"\\n\\n\"Pan again!\" said Dr. Bull irritably. \"You seem to think Pan is\\neverything.\"\\n\\n\"So he is,\" said the Professor, \"in Greek. He means everything.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t forget,\" said the Secretary, looking down, \"that he also\\nmeans Panic.\"\\n\\nSyme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations.\\n\\n\"It fell over there,\" he said shortly. \"Let us follow it!\"\\n\\nThen he added with an indescribable gesture--\\n\\n\"Oh, if he has cheated us all by getting killed! It would be like\\none of his larks.\"\\n\\nHe strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy, his rags\\nand ribbons fluttering in the wind. The others followed him in a\\nmore footsore and dubious manner. And almost at the same moment all\\nsix men realised that they were not alone in the little field.\\n\\nAcross the square of turf a tall man was advancing towards them,\\nleaning on a strange long staff like a sceptre. He was clad in a\\nfine but old-fashioned suit with knee-breeches; its colour was\\nthat shade between blue, violet and grey which can be seen in\\ncertain shadows of the woodland. His hair was whitish grey, and\\nat the first glance, taken along with his knee-breeches, looked\\nas if it was powdered. His advance was very quiet; but for the\\nsilver frost upon his head, he might have been one to the shadows\\nof the wood.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"my master has a carriage waiting for you in\\nthe road just by.\"\\n\\n\"Who is your master?\" asked Syme, standing quite still.\\n\\n\"I was told you knew his name,\" said the man respectfully.\\n\\nThere was a silence, and then the Secretary said--\\n\\n\"Where is this carriage?\"\\n\\n\"It has been waiting only a few moments,\" said the stranger. \"My\\nmaster has only just come home.\"\\n\\nSyme looked left and right upon the patch of green field in which\\nhe found himself. The hedges were ordinary hedges, the trees seemed\\nordinary trees; yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland.\\n\\nHe looked the mysterious ambassador up and down, but he could\\ndiscover nothing except that the man\\'s coat was the exact colour of\\nthe purple shadows, and that the man\\'s face was the exact colour of\\nthe red and brown and golden sky.\\n\\n\"Show us the place,\" Syme said briefly, and without a word the man\\nin the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the\\nhedge, which let in suddenly the light of a white road.\\n\\nAs the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare, they saw the\\nwhite road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages,\\nsuch a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house\\nin Park Lane. Along the side of these carriages stood a rank of\\nsplendid servants, all dressed in the grey-blue uniform, and all\\nhaving a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not\\ncommonly belong to the servants of a gentleman, but rather to the\\nofficials and ambassadors of a great king. There were no less than\\nsix carriages waiting, one for each of the tattered and miserable\\nband. All the attendants (as if in court-dress) wore swords, and as\\neach man crawled into his carriage they drew them, and saluted with\\na sudden blaze of steel.\\n\\n\"What can it all mean?\" asked Bull of Syme as they separated. \"Is\\nthis another joke of Sunday\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Syme as he sank wearily back in the cushions\\nof his carriage; \"but if it is, it\\'s one of the jokes you talk\\nabout. It\\'s a good-natured one.\"\\n\\nThe six adventurers had passed through many adventures, but not one\\nhad carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure\\nof comfort. They had all become inured to things going roughly; but\\nthings suddenly going smoothly swamped them. They could not even\\nfeebly imagine what the carriages were; it was enough for them to\\nknow that they were carriages, and carriages with cushions. They\\ncould not conceive who the old man was who had led them; but it was\\nquite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages.\\n\\nSyme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter\\nabandonment. It was typical of him that while he had carried his\\nbearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done,\\nwhen the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back\\non the cushions in a frank collapse.\\n\\nVery gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads\\nthe carriage was carrying him. He saw that they passed the stone\\ngates of what might have been a park, that they began gradually to\\nclimb a hill which, while wooded on both sides, was somewhat more\\norderly than a forest. Then there began to grow upon him, as upon a\\nman slowly waking from a healthy sleep, a pleasure in everything.\\nHe felt that the hedges were what hedges should be, living walls;\\nthat a hedge is like a human army, disciplined, but all the more\\nalive. He saw high elms behind the hedges, and vaguely thought how\\nhappy boys would be climbing there. Then his carriage took a turn\\nof the path, and he saw suddenly and quietly, like a long, low,\\nsunset cloud, a long, low house, mellow in the mild light of\\nsunset. All the six friends compared notes afterwards and\\nquarrelled; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the\\nplace reminded them of their boyhood. It was either this elm-top\\nor that crooked path, it was either this scrap of orchard or that\\nshape of a window; but each man of them declared that he could\\nremember this place before he could remember his mother.\\n\\nWhen the carriages eventually rolled up to a large, low, cavernous\\ngateway, another man in the same uniform, but wearing a silver star\\non the grey breast of his coat, came out to meet them. This\\nimpressive person said to the bewildered Syme--\\n\\n\"Refreshments are provided for you in your room.\"\\n\\nSyme, under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement,\\nwent up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant. He\\nentered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed\\nspecially for him. He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary\\ninstinct of his class, to pull his tie straight or to smooth his\\nhair; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was--blood\\nrunning down his face from where the bough had struck him, his hair\\nstanding out like yellow rags of rank grass, his clothes torn into\\nlong, wavering tatters. At once the whole enigma sprang up, simply\\nas the question of how he had got there, and how he was to get out\\nagain. Exactly at the same moment a man in blue, who had been\\nappointed as his valet, said very solemnly--\\n\\n\"I have put out your clothes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Clothes!\" said Syme sardonically. \"I have no clothes except\\nthese,\" and he lifted two long strips of his frock-coat in\\nfascinating festoons, and made a movement as if to twirl like\\na ballet girl.\\n\\n\"My master asks me to say,\" said the attendant, that there is a\\nfancy dress ball tonight, and that he desires you to put on the\\ncostume that I have laid out. Meanwhile, sir, there is a bottle\\nof Burgundy and some cold pheasant, which he hopes you will not\\nrefuse, as it is some hours before supper.\"\\n\\n\"Cold pheasant is a good thing,\" said Syme reflectively, \"and\\nBurgundy is a spanking good thing. But really I do not want either\\nof them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means,\\nand what sort of costume you have got laid out for me. Where is\\nit?\"\\n\\nThe servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock-blue\\ndrapery, rather of the nature of a domino, on the front of which\\nwas emblazoned a large golden sun, and which was splashed here\\nand there with flaming stars and crescents.\\n\\n\"You\\'re to be dressed as Thursday, sir,\" said the valet somewhat\\naffably.\\n\\n\"Dressed as Thursday!\" said Syme in meditation. \"It doesn\\'t sound\\na warm costume.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said the other eagerly, \"the Thursday costume is\\nquite warm, sir. It fastens up to the chin.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t understand anything,\" said Syme, sighing. \"I have\\nbeen used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable\\nadventures knock me out. Still, I may be allowed to ask why I\\nshould be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted\\nall over with the sun and moon. Those orbs, I think, shine on\\nother days. I once saw the moon on Tuesday, I remember.\"\\n\\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said the valet, \"Bible also provided for you,\"\\nand with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage\\nin the first chapter of Genesis. Syme read it wondering. It was\\nthat in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the\\ncreation of the sun and moon. Here, however, they reckoned from\\na Christian Sunday.\\n\\n\"This is getting wilder and wilder,\" said Syme, as he sat down\\nin a chair. \"Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and\\nBurgundy, and green clothes and Bibles? Do they provide\\neverything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, everything,\" said the attendant gravely. \"Shall I help\\nyou on with your costume?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, hitch the bally thing on!\" said Syme impatiently.\\n\\nBut though he affected to despise the mummery, he felt a curious\\nfreedom and naturalness in his movements as the blue and gold\\ngarment fell about him; and when he found that he had to wear a\\nsword, it stirred a boyish dream. As he passed out of the room he\\nflung the folds across his shoulder with a gesture, his sword\\nstood out at an angle, and he had all the swagger of a troubadour.\\nFor these disguises did not disguise, but reveal.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nTHE ACCUSER\\n\\nAS Syme strode along the corridor he saw the Secretary standing at\\nthe top of a great flight of stairs. The man had never looked so\\nnoble. He was draped in a long robe of starless black, down the\\ncentre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white, like a\\nsingle shaft of light. The whole looked like some very severe\\necclesiastical vestment. There was no need for Syme to search his\\nmemory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of\\ncreation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness. The\\nvestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol; and Syme\\nfelt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black\\nexpressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary, with his\\ninhuman veracity and his cold frenzy, which made him so easily\\nmake war on the anarchists, and yet so easily pass for one of\\nthem. Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that, amid all the\\nease and hospitality of their new surroundings, this man\\'s eyes\\nwere still stern. No smell of ale or orchards could make the\\nSecretary cease to ask a reasonable question.\\n\\nIf Syme had been able to see himself, he would have realised that\\nhe, too, seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else.\\nFor if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the\\noriginal and formless light, Syme was a type of the poet who seeks\\nalways to make the light in special shapes, to split it up into\\nsun and star. The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite; the\\npoet always loves the finite. For him the great moment is not the\\ncreation of light, but the creation of the sun and moon.\\n\\nAs they descended the broad stairs together they overtook\\nRatcliffe, who was clad in spring green like a huntsman, and the\\npattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees. For he\\nstood for that third day on which the earth and green things were\\nmade, and his square, sensible face, with its not unfriendly\\ncynicism, seemed appropriate enough to it.\\n\\nThey were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very\\nlarge old English garden, full of torches and bonfires, by the\\nbroken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in\\nmotley dress. Syme seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated\\nin some crazy costume. There was a man dressed as a windmill with\\nenormous sails, a man dressed as an elephant, a man dressed as a\\nballoon; the two last, together, seemed to keep the thread of\\ntheir farcical adventures. Syme even saw, with a queer thrill,\\none dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill, with a beak twice\\nas big as himself--the queer bird which had fixed itself on his\\nfancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long\\nroad at the Zoological Gardens. There were a thousand other such\\nobjects, however. There was a dancing lamp-post, a dancing apple\\ntree, a dancing ship. One would have thought that the untamable\\ntune of some mad musician had set all the common objects of field\\nand street dancing an eternal jig. And long afterwards, when Syme\\nwas middle-aged and at rest, he could never see one of those\\nparticular objects--a lamppost, or an apple tree, or a windmill--\\nwithout thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel\\nof masquerade.\\n\\nOn one side of this lawn, alive with dancers, was a sort of green\\nbank, like the terrace in such old-fashioned gardens.\\n\\nAlong this, in a kind of crescent, stood seven great chairs, the\\nthrones of the seven days. Gogol and Dr. Bull were already in their\\nseats; the Professor was just mounting to his. Gogol, or Tuesday,\\nhad his simplicity well symbolised by a dress designed upon the\\ndivision of the waters, a dress that separated upon his forehead\\nand fell to his feet, grey and silver, like a sheet of rain. The\\nProfessor, whose day was that on which the birds and fishes--the\\nruder forms of life--were created, had a dress of dim purple, over\\nwhich sprawled goggle-eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds,\\nthe union in him of unfathomable fancy and of doubt. Dr. Bull, the\\nlast day of Creation, wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in\\nred and gold, and on his crest a man rampant. He lay back in his\\nchair with a broad smile, the picture of an optimist in his\\nelement.\\n\\nOne by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their\\nstrange seats. As each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose\\nfrom the carnival, such as that with which crowds receive kings.\\nCups were clashed and torches shaken, and feathered hats flung in\\nthe air. The men for whom these thrones were reserved were men\\ncrowned with some extraordinary laurels. But the central chair was\\nempty.\\n\\nSyme was on the left hand of it and the Secretary on the right.\\nThe Secretary looked across the empty throne at Syme, and said,\\ncompressing his lips--\\n\\n\"We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field.\"\\n\\nAlmost as Syme heard the words, he saw on the sea of human faces in\\nfront of him a frightful and beautiful alteration, as if heaven had\\nopened behind his head. But Sunday had only passed silently along\\nthe front like a shadow, and had sat in the central seat. He was\\ndraped plainly, in a pure and terrible white, and his hair was like\\na silver flame on his forehead.\\n\\nFor a long time--it seemed for hours--that huge masquerade of\\nmankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and\\nexultant music. Every couple dancing seemed a separate romance;\\nit might be a fairy dancing with a pillar-box, or a peasant girl\\ndancing with the moon; but in each case it was, somehow, as\\nabsurd as Alice in Wonderland, yet as grave and kind as a love\\nstory. At last, however, the thick crowd began to thin itself.\\nCouples strolled away into the garden-walks, or began to drift\\ntowards that end of the building where stood smoking, in huge\\npots like fish-kettles, some hot and scented mixtures of old ale\\nor wine. Above all these, upon a sort of black framework on the\\nroof of the house, roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire,\\nwhich lit up the land for miles. It flung the homely effect of\\nfirelight over the face of vast forests of grey or brown, and it\\nseemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness of upper night.\\nYet this also, after a time, was allowed to grow fainter; the\\ndim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons, or\\npassed, laughing and clattering, into the inner passages of that\\nancient house. Soon there were only some ten loiterers in the\\ngarden; soon only four. Finally the last stray merry-maker ran\\ninto the house whooping to his companions. The fire faded, and\\nthe slow, strong stars came out. And the seven strange men were\\nleft alone, like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone.\\nNot one of them had spoken a word.\\n\\nThey seemed in no haste to do so, but heard in silence the hum of\\ninsects and the distant song of one bird. Then Sunday spoke, but\\nso dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation\\nrather than beginning one.\\n\\n\"We will eat and drink later,\" he said. \"Let us remain together a\\nlittle, we who have loved each other so sadly, and have fought so\\nlong. I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war, in which\\nyou were always heroes--epic on epic, iliad on iliad, and you\\nalways brothers in arms. Whether it was but recently (for time is\\nnothing), or at the beginning of the world, I sent you out to\\nwar. I sat in the darkness, where there is not any created thing,\\nand to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural\\nvirtue. You heard the voice in the dark, and you never heard it\\nagain. The sun in heaven denied it, the earth and sky denied it,\\nall human wisdom denied it. And when I met you in the daylight I\\ndenied it myself.\"\\n\\nSyme stirred sharply in his seat, but otherwise there was silence,\\nand the incomprehensible went on.\\n\\n\"But you were men. You did not forget your secret honour, though\\nthe whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of\\nyou. I knew how near you were to hell. I know how you, Thursday,\\ncrossed swords with King Satan, and how you, Wednesday, named me\\nin the hour without hope.\"\\n\\nThere was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the\\nblack-browed Secretary, implacable, turned in his chair towards\\nSunday, and said in a harsh voice--\\n\\n\"Who and what are you?\"\\n\\n\"I am the Sabbath,\" said the other without moving. \"I am the peace\\nof God.\"\\n\\nThe Secretary started up, and stood crushing his costly robe in his\\nhand.\\n\\n\"I know what you mean,\" he cried, \"and it is exactly that that I\\ncannot forgive you. I know you are contentment, optimism, what do\\nthey call the thing, an ultimate reconciliation. Well, I am not\\nreconciled. If you were the man in the dark room, why were you also\\nSunday, an offense to the sunlight? If you were from the first our\\nfather and our friend, why were you also our greatest enemy? We\\nwept, we fled in terror; the iron entered into our souls--and you\\nare the peace of God! Oh, I can forgive God His anger, though it\\ndestroyed nations; but I cannot forgive Him His peace.\"\\n\\nSunday answered not a word, but very slowly he turned his face of\\nstone upon Syme as if asking a question.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme, \"I do not feel fierce like that. I am grateful\\nto you, not only for wine and hospitality here, but for many a\\nfine scamper and free fight. But I should like to know. My soul\\nand heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden, but my\\nreason is still crying out. I should like to know.\"\\n\\nSunday looked at Ratcliffe, whose clear voice said--\\n\\n\"It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and\\nfought yourself.\"\\n\\nBull said--\\n\\n\"l understand nothing, but I am happy. In fact, I am going to\\nsleep.\"\\n\\n\"I am not happy,\" said the Professor with his head in his hands,\\n\"because I do not understand. You let me stray a little too near\\nto hell.\"\\n\\nAnd then Gogol said, with the absolute simplicity of a child--\\n\\n\"I wish I knew why I was hurt so much.\"\\n\\nStill Sunday said nothing, but only sat with his mighty chin upon\\nhis hand, and gazed at the distance. Then at last he said--\\n\\n\"I have heard your complaints in order. And here, I think, comes\\nanother to complain, and we will hear him also.\"\\n\\nThe falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam, like\\na bar of burning gold, across the dim grass. Against this fiery\\nband was outlined in utter black the advancing legs of a black-clad\\nfigure. He seemed to have a fine close suit with knee-breeches such\\nas that which was worn by the servants of the house, only that it\\nwas not blue, but of this absolute sable. He had, like the\\nservants, a kind of word by his side. It was only when he had come\\nquite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to\\nlook at them, that Syme saw, with thunder-struck clearness, that\\nthe face was the broad, almost ape-like face of his old friend\\nGregory, with its rank red hair and its insulting smile.\\n\\n\"Gregory!\" gasped Syme, half-rising from his seat. \"Why, this is\\nthe real anarchist!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Gregory, with a great and dangerous restraint, \"I am\\nthe real anarchist.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Now there was a day,\\'\" murmured Bull, who seemed really to have\\nfallen asleep, \"\\'when the sons of God came to present themselves\\nbefore the Lord, and Satan came also among them.\\'\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said Gregory, and gazed all round. \"I am a\\ndestroyer. I would destroy the world if I could.\"\\n\\nA sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in Syme, and\\nhe spoke brokenly and without sequence.\\n\\n\"Oh, most unhappy man,\" he cried, \"try to be happy! You have red\\nhair like your sister.\"\\n\\n\"My red hair, like red flames, shall burn up the world,\" said\\nGregory. \"I thought I hated everything more than common men can\\nhate anything; but I find that I do not hate everything so much\\nas I hate you! \"\\n\\n\"I never hated you,\" said Syme very sadly.\\n\\nThen out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke.\\n\\n\"You!\" he cried. \"You never hated because you never lived. I know\\nwhat you are all of you, from first to last--you are the people\\nin power! You are the police--the great fat, smiling men in blue\\nand buttons! You are the Law, and you have never been broken. But\\nis there a free soul alive that does not long to break you, only\\nbecause you have never been broken? We in revolt talk all kind of\\nnonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the\\nGovernment. It is all folly! The only crime of the Government is\\nthat it governs. The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is\\nthat it is supreme. I do not curse you for being cruel. I do not\\ncurse you (though I might) for being kind. I curse you for being\\nsafe! You sit in your chairs of stone, and have never come down\\nfrom them. You are the seven angels of heaven, and you have had\\nno troubles. Oh, I could forgive you everything, you that rule\\nall mankind, if I could feel for once that you had suffered for\\none hour a real agony such as I--\"\\n\\nSyme sprang to his feet, shaking from head to foot.\\n\\n\"I see everything,\" he cried, \"everything that there is. Why does\\neach thing on the earth war against each other thing? Why does\\neach small thing in the world have to fight against the world\\nitself? Why does a fly have to fight the whole universe? Why does\\na dandelion have to fight the whole universe? For the same reason\\nthat I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days. So\\nthat each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of\\nthe anarchist. So that each man fighting for order may be as brave\\nand good a man as the dynamiter. So that the real lie of Satan may\\nbe flung back in the face of this blasphemer, so that by tears and\\ntorture we may earn the right to say to this man, \\'You lie!\\' No\\nagonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser,\\n\\'We also have suffered.\\'\\n\\n\"It is not true that we have never been broken. We have been broken\\nupon the wheel. It is not true that we have never descended from\\nthese thrones. We have descended into hell. We were complaining of\\nunforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man\\nentered insolently to accuse us of happiness. I repel the slander;\\nwe have not been happy. I can answer for every one of the great\\nguards of Law whom he has accused. At least--\"\\n\\nHe had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of\\nSunday, which wore a strange smile.\\n\\n\"Have you,\" he cried in a dreadful voice, \"have you ever suffered?\"\\n\\nAs he gazed, the great face grew to an awful size, grew larger than\\nthe colossal mask of Memnon, which had made him scream as a child.\\nIt grew larger and larger, filling the whole sky; then everything\\nwent black. Only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his\\nbrain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text\\nthat he had heard somewhere, \"Can ye drink of the cup that I drink\\nof?\"\\n\\n*    *    *\\n\\nWhen men in books awake from a vision, they commonly find\\nthemselves in some place in which they might have fallen asleep;\\nthey yawn in a chair, or lift themselves with bruised limbs from a\\nfield. Syme\\'s experience was something much more psychologically\\nstrange if there was indeed anything unreal, in the earthly sense,\\nabout the things he had gone through. For while he could always\\nremember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of Sunday,\\nhe could not remember having ever come to at all. He could only\\nremember that gradually and naturally he knew that he was and had\\nbeen walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational\\ncompanion. That companion had been a part of his recent drama; it\\nwas the red-haired poet Gregory. They were walking like old\\nfriends, and were in the middle of a conversation about some\\ntriviality. But Syme could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his\\nbody and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be\\nsuperior to everything that he said or did. He felt he was in\\npossession of some impossible good news, which made every other\\nthing a triviality, but an adorable triviality.\\n\\nDawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and\\ntimid; as if Nature made a first attempt at yellow and a first\\nattempt at rose. A breeze blew so clean and sweet, that one could\\nnot think that it blew from the sky; it blew rather through some\\nhole in the sky. Syme felt a simple surprise when he saw rising all\\nround him on both sides of the road the red, irregular buildings of\\nSaffron Park. He had no idea that he had walked so near London. He\\nwalked by instinct along one white road, on which early birds\\nhopped and sang, and found himself outside a fenced garden. There\\nhe saw the sister of Gregory, the girl with the gold-red hair,\\ncutting lilac before breakfast, with the great unconscious gravity\\nof a girl.\\n\\n'"
